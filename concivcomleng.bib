Existing studies established their scope of usage in several areas of endeavors but have hardly addressed their negative implication for using them in socio-political scenario of Nigeria which sometimes seems to be counterproductive and having overbearing effect on peace and stability of the Nation. The paper adopts Marxist theory for its ability to explain reason for political and economic crisis in government and what the oppressed members of society must do to liberate themselves from such crisis. Eight protest songs were purposively selected from the Nigerian political scenario of the past for having sufficient usage of the Yor\`ub\'a protest songs imbued with curse, hate expressions, abuse, derision and ridicule/sarcasm. In order to strike a balance, four corrupt coinages of the Christian songs and the other four corrupt coinages of the Yor\`ub\'a traditional songs were eventually subjected to stylistic analysis. In all, politics, financial fraud and jubilation were expressed and contextualized in curse, ridicule/sarcasm, derision, hatred and abusive utterances all of which are capable of destabilizing peace and unity of the country. Yoruba protest songs in this paper are corrupt coinages of both Christian and Yor\`ub\'a traditional songs used to express socio-political issues in Nigeria and conveyed through curse, hate expressions, derision, sarcasm, abusive utterances and also reflect ingenuity-constrained stylistic choices.}

Despite the importance of political inequality, not enough is known about the mechanisms that reproduce it. Political socialization research has focused on the transmission of political attitudes and culture across generations, but it has paid scant attention to how family transfers of economic resources, human capital, and social capital reproduce and perpetuate unequal patterns of political involvement and political authority. This article argues that more attention should be paid to measuring the persistence of political identity, political participation, civic engagement, and political influence networks over time and across generations. Special attention should be devoted to learning more about how the passage of family resources (economic resources, human capital, social capital, and cultural capital) from parents to children reproduces political inequality and reduces the opportunity for political mobility. Current data sources fall far short of what is needed to answer these questions, but linking the proposed American Opportunity Study with public voting records and with the American National Election Studies would provide a rich and powerful dataset for studying them.},

This interweaves with an analysis on the influence of the representations of teachers and the attitudes of the families in the learning process of reading. Finally, some aspects of the politic field will be analyzed to reflect on which pedagogical spaces are sensitive and worthwhile to a reformulation of reading as a potential creator link of civic responsibility.

  abstract = {While a substantial literature explores gender differences in participation in                     the United States, Commonwealth countries and Western Europe, little attention                     has been given to gender's impact on participation in the developing                     world. These countries have diverse experiences with gender politics: some have                     been leaders in suffrage reforms and equal rights, while, in others, divorce has                     only recently been legalized. This article examines the relationship between                     gender and participation in seventeen Latin American countries. Many core                     results from research in the developed world hold in Latin America as well.                     Surprisingly, however, there is no evidence that economic development provides                     an impetus for more equal levels of participation. Instead, the most important                     contextual factors are civil liberties and women's presence among the                     visible political elite.},

Focusing on the next career stage, our multi-level analysis (58,944 respondents in 31 societies) shows that it furthers children's later occupational career even more than parents' education or occupation, especially in developing nations where there is a small additional advantage beyond the educational gains. This evidence supports the scholarly culture hypothesis that book-oriented socialization provides a ``toolkit'' of competencies, skills, and knowledge (Kohn, Spaeth). It is not consistent with elite closure/cultural capital theories that elites use cultural signals to recognize members and hoard advantages by discriminating on the basis of culture (Bourdieu, Goblot).}

Estos textos recapitulan las principales estaciones de su pensamiento: no solo el giro imprimido a la Teor\'ia Cr\'itica en el sentido de una teor\'ia del reconocimiento, sino tambi\'en la pluralidad de campos en los que se desarrolla su filosof\'ia y la direcci\'on en la que esta se orienta. El giro "recognoscitivo"--Que busca salvar algunos de los d\'eficits de la Teor\'ia Cr\'itica-- describe una espiral continua que transita desde el an\'alisis de las patolog\'ias sociales hasta el estudio de las patolog\'ias de la raz\'on. Se inscribe as\'i en un proyecto m\'as amplio que, desde la "lucha" asociada al reconocimiento, pretende examinar sus negaciones, es decir, aquellas manifestaciones que se expresan en nociones como "desintegraci\'on", "desgarramiento", "patolog\'ia", "cosificaci\'on" o "desprecio". Despu\'es de que Max Horkheimer formulara el programa filos\'ofico y sociol\'ogico del Instituto de Investigaci\'on Social como "Teor\'ia Cr\'itica", Honneth --con no menos obstinaci\'on que su maestro J\"urgen Habermas o que Theodor W. Adorno-- contin\'ua trenzando y destrenzando los hilos que penden de aquella consigna tal vez parad\'ojica, cabos que se anudan con las pr\'acticas sociales y que transcurren por no pocos \'ambitos del saber. Se trata del esfuerzo urgente de quienes, en la sociedad del desprecio, advierten la emergencia de la barbarie que ya ha acaecido y solo se permiten el ejercicio de la raz\'on para escapar de la caverna plat\'onica.(Nota Ed.).},

(2) Unequal turnout spells unequal political influence. (3) U.S. voter turnout is especially low, but, measured as percent of voting-age population, it is also relatively low in most other countries. (4) Turnout in midterm, regional, local, and supranational elections\textemdash less salient but by no means unimportant elections\textemdash tends to be especially poor. (5) Turnout appears to be declining everywhere. The problem of inequality can be solved by institutional mechanisms that maximize turnout. One option is the combination of voter-friendly registration rules, proportional representation, infrequent elections, weekend voting, and holding less salient elections concurrently with the most important national elections. The other option, which can maximize turnout by itself, is compulsory voting. Its advantages far outweigh the normative and practical objections to it.},

The book offers a wide range of concepts and theorems that can be applied to politics and the economy, religion and science, art and education, organization and the family. Moreover, Luhmann's ideas address important contemporary issues in such diverse fields as cognitive science, ecology, and the study of social movements.This book provides all the necessary resources for readers to work through the foundations of systems theory - no other work by Luhmann is as clear and accessible as this. There is also much here that will be of great interest to more advanced scholars and practitioners in sociology and the social sciences},

Este estudio indaga la validez de los cuestionarios del estudiante ICCS 2009 en el contexto educacional chileno y aborda el tema desde la deseabilidad social. Tiene el objetivo de identificar el posible impacto de esta en las respuestas de los estudiantes chilenos en el cuestionario internacional y en el cuestionario del m\'odulo latinoamericano ICCS 2009. Para el presente estudio, se seleccion\'o una muestra de estudiantes de 8\textordmasculine{} B\'asico a la cual se le aplic\'o ambos cuestionarios y la escala de Deseabilidad Social de Marlowe Crowne, que entrega un puntaje individual de deseabilidad social. Para cada \'item de los cuestionarios los estudiantes se agruparon de acuerdo con la respuesta escogida en el \'item y se compararon los puntajes promedios obtenidos por cada grupo en la escala de DS a trav\'es de un an\'alisis de varianza de un factor (ANOVA). Se concluye que la DS s\'i se relaciona con las respuestas escogidas por los estudiantes chilenos en los cuestionarios, pero esto sucede solo en algunos \'items: aproximadamente un tercio de los \'items del ML y un cuarto de los \'items del CI se relacionan con la DS, de manera que su validez podr\'ia verse afectada, por lo tanto esta relaci\'on no se extiende a los instrumentos en su totalidad. En el presente documento se identifican los \'items y escalas de los cuestionarios que son afectados por la DS y que, por lo tanto, habr\'ia que interpretar con precauci\'on. Los temas m\'as relacionados con la DS en el CI son: la confianza de los estudiantes en las instituciones, su percepci\'on de la relaci\'on entre profesores y estudiantes, su inter\'es en temas pol\'iticos y sociales y su sentido de autoeficacia pol\'itica. En el ML los temas m\'as afectados son las actitudes hacia la violencia, los sentimientos de empat\'ia hacia los compa\~neros de curso y la experiencia personal de los estudiantes de maltrato por parte de sus pares. Palabras clave: validez de cuestionarios-deseabilidad social}

  abstract = {En las \'ultimas d\'ecadas se ha observado una serie de amenazas a la democracia y su legitimidad. Por un lado, la persistente desigualdad en el acceso a las formas de voz pol\'itica y su v\'inculo estrecho con las condiciones socioecon\'omicas, mientras por otro, una serie de indicios que muestran una creciente desafecci\'on pol\'itica, particularmente de poblaciones juveniles. La preocupaci\'on por el futuro de la democracia ha volcado la mirada hacia las diversas fuentes de socializaci\'on pol\'itica y la formaci\'on de los futuros ciudadanos. Esta tesis doctoral trata acerca de la siguiente pregunta de investigaci\'on: \textquestiondown En qu\'e medida las desigualdades en las fuentes de socializaci\'on se relacionan con las diferentes expresiones de ciudadan\'ia en los j\'ovenes? Espec\'ificamente, \textquestiondown en qu\'e medida las caracter\'isticas socioecon\'omicas de la familia se traducen en actitudes y participaci\'on ciudadana de la siguiente generaci\'on? Aborda, por un lado, la pregunta acerca de \textquestiondown cu\'ales son las principales dimensiones de un concepto amplio de ciudadan\'ia juvenil?, y por otro, en la comprensi\'on sobre \textquestiondown qu\'e mecanismospermiten explicar el proceso de transmisi\'on intergeneracional de la desigualdad pol\'itica? Se organiza principalmente en torno una introducci\'on general y cuatro art\'iculos que abordan las preguntas de investigaci\'on formuladas. Para abordar dichas preguntas se hizo uso del Estudio Internacional de Educaci\'on C\'ivica y Ciudadana el a\~no 2009 (International Civic and Citizenship Study- ICCS 2009), que consideran estudiantes de 15 a\~nos provenientes de un set de 38 pa\'ises. Los datos provistos por ICCS representan una oportunidad \'unica para el estudio de fuentes de socializaci\'on pol\'iticas en diversos contextos y el abordaje de estas preguntas de investigaci\'on. Los resultados de esta tesis corroboran que la participaci\'on ciudadana juvenil puede ser entendida y medida como un concepto amplio que contiene diversos tipos de comportamiento organizados en tres dimensiones: participaci\'on formal, participaci\'on activista y participaci\'on comunitaria. As\'i mismo se cofirma que las actitudes hacia la igualdad de derechos puede ser medida como una composici\'on de las opiniones referidas a la igualdad de derechos de diversos grupos sociales hist\'oricamente excluidos. Respecto de la transmisi\'on intergeneracional de la desigualdad pol\'itica se observa que los recursos socioecon\'omicos ejercen una importante influencia en los diferentes tipos de participaci\'on y en las actitudes hacia la igualdad de derechos, siendo la educaci\'on lograda por lo padres y los libros disponibles en el hogar las formas de estratificaci\'on m\'as relevantes para explicar el comportamiento y las actitudes ciudadanas. La educaci\'on lograda por los padres y las consecuencias que ello implica para sus propias disposiciones democr\'aticas se traspasa a los hijos principalmente en forma de una mayor disposici\'on hacia la participaci\'on formal y mayor apoyo a la igualdad de g\'enero. En contraste, aquellas familias que presentan una mayor orientaci\'on hacia la cultura escolar, que se manifiesta en disponer de m\'as libros en el hogar, tienden a generar en sus hijos mayores disposiciones ciudadanas transversales, es decir, esos hijos est\'an dispuestos a participar m\'as y apoyan m\'as la igualdad de derechos para los diferentes grupos sociales. Esto implica que j\'ovenes que crecen en familias con m\'as recursos literarios en casa estar\'ian m\'as dispuestos a votar, a asistir a una marcha, a ayudar a resolver un problema de su comunidad y/o a apoyar la igualdad de derechos de todos los grupos sociales. Finalmente, confirmando lo argumentado por Schlozman, Verba, \& Brady (2012), las ventajas socioecon\'omicas se traducen en ventajas para el ejercicio de la ciudadan\'ia por dos v\'ias principalmente: por medio del ambiente pol\'itico m\'as rico que genera la familia (p.e. nivel de actividad pol\'itica) y/o la reproducci\'on del estatus familiar hacia la nueva generaci\'on, manifestado en la transmisi\'on de habilidades cognitivas necesarias para desarrollar un mayor estatus (p.e. habilidades c\'ivicas y/o conocimiento). Se discuten las principales contribuciones te\'oricas y emp\'iricas, las principales limitaciones y propuestas de futuras investigaci\'on.},

  abstract = {A principios del siglo XX, el censo de poblaci\'on revel\'o que 7 de cada 10 campesinos chilenos eran analfabetos. Si bien la instrucci\'on de adultos ven\'ia siendo una preocupaci\'on ya desde fines del siglo XIX, no fue sino hasta la d\'ecada de 1920 que se emprendieron las primeras iniciativas dirigidas a solucionar el problema en la poblaci\'on rural. Dichas medidas se enfocaron inicialmente solo en la lectoescritura, para luego ampliarse tambi\'en a lo social y a lo pol\'itico. El analfabetismo: enemigo nacional Los gobiernos de los radicales Pedro Aguirre Cerda (1938-1941) y Juan Antonio R\'ios (1941-1946) fueron los primeros en abordar el analfabetismo espec\'ificamente en el campesinado. La soluci\'on se concibi\'o desde dos perspectivas: por un lado, como una cruzada c\'ivica, apelando a la contribuci\'on voluntaria de la ciudadan\'ia al esfuerzo nacional por disminuir el n\'umero de analfabetos; por otro, a partir de una mirada pedag\'ogica contextualizada, que subrayaba la importancia de incluir elementos de la realidad sociocultural del campesino a la hora de instruirlo. Algunas de aquellas iniciativas fueron criticadas por no lograr una transformaci\'on efectiva de la situaci\'on del campesinado. En vista de ello, algunos diputados propusieron en 1951 una campa\~na estatal para disminuir el porcentaje de analfabetos en el pa\'is. Basada en el concepto de ``educaci\'on fundamental'' promovido por la Unesco desde fines de la d\'ecada de 1940, la iniciativa fue aprobada en 1954 y conocida como ``Campa\~na Extraordinaria de Alfabetizaci\'on Popular''. M\'as all\'a de la alfabetizaci\'on El gobierno de Frei Montalva abord\'o la educaci\'on de adultos como una preocupaci\'on intersectorial. En particular, al interior del Ministerio de Educaci\'on se cre\'o la Jefatura de Planes Extraordinarios de Educaci\'on de Adultos \textendash espec\'ifica para dicho \'ambito\textendash{} y se adopt\'o el m\'etodo psicosocial del pedagogo brasile\~no Paulo Freire. Paralelamente, con el imperativo de modernizar la estructura productiva del pa\'is, la reforma agraria promovi\'o un concepto integral de educaci\'on campesina \textendash siempre en la l\'inea de la educaci\'on fundamental\textendash. Implementados durante las d\'ecadas de 1950 y 1960, tales esfuerzos lograron su prop\'osito de disminuir las tasas de analfabetismo. Seg\'un las cifras entregadas por el Censo de Poblaci\'on y Vivienda, 665362 personas se declaraban analfabetas en 1970, lo cual correspond\'ia a un 10,2 \% del total de la poblaci\'on del pa\'is.aqu\'i el texto central de la colecci\'on digital.

This is particularly the case for the majority of states in Eastern Europe where turnout in European elections has resulted in low electoral participation of eligible voters. Focusing on the 2014 election to the European Parliament, we highlight that low election-specific knowledge contributes to these low participation rates. In more detail, we rely on name recognition of the main candidates of the three main party groups, and show that knowledge of these candidates is more than twice as high in Western Europe as in Eastern Europe. Second, we illustrate that these low knowledge levels in the East also help explain the larger turnout gap between national and European elections in the East.},

The duration of symptoms lasted 5 minutes to 48 hours. After recovery the children had no difficulties; the mean of follow-up was 3.3 years. The EEG showed predominantly a normal picture or only abnormal background activity of bioccipital slow waves. In the history and clinical picture we found after the attack most often perinatal abnormality and minimal brain dysfunction (15x, 57\%) and various forms of migraine (4x, 16\%). It indicates that in the pathogenesis of benign posttraumatic encephalopathy apparently an important part is played by pretraumatic cerebral affection.},

The status of women in each state was assessed by four composite indices measuring women's political participation, economic autonomy, employment and earnings, and reproductive rights.

Our main outcome measures were total female and male mortality rates, female cause-specific death rates and mean days of activity limitations reported by women during the previous month. Measures of women's status were strikingly correlated with each of these health outcomes at the state level. Higher political participation by women was correlated with lower female mortality rates (r = -0.51), as well as lower activity limitations (-0.47). A smaller wage gap between women and men was associated with lower female mortality rates (-0.30) and lower activity limitations (-0.31) (all correlations, P \textexclamdown{} 0.05). Indices of women's status were also strongly correlated with male mortality rates, suggesting that women's status may reflect more general underlying structural processes associated with material deprivation and income inequality. However, the indices of women's status persisted in predicting female mortality and morbidity rates after adjusting for income inequality, poverty rates and median household income. Associations were observed for specific causes of death, including stroke, cervical cancer and homicide. We conclude that women experience higher mortality and morbidity in states where they have lower levels of political participation and economic autonomy. Living in such states has detrimental consequences for the health of men as well.

  abstract = {Objective. Studies of the gender gap in electoral behavior have now become a familiar feature of social science research. Yet there is still disagreement about its nature and extent as well as what accounts for its development. This paper examines male-female differences in voting behavior in terms of three frequently offered explanations: inequalities in socioeconomic attainment, greater situational constraints on women, and differences in political orientations. Methods. We analyze survey data from the 1993 Australian Election Survey, the 1992 British Election Survey, and the 1992 American National Election Survey by using a regression decomposition technique for blocks of variables representing each of the three explanations for gender differences. Results. Our findings provide some evidence to support each explanation. For example, in both Britain and Australia, the two major consistently discriminating factors are gender inequalities in socioeconomic attainment and situational constraints. Such factors as women's greater familial responsibilities and their differing occupational experiences help explain the gender gap in these countries. In the United States, however, it is predominantly political orientations-namely, that women are significantly more likely to favor the left side of some common political issues, which explains their differing electoral choices. Conclusions. Although gender differences in voting behavior are a widely observed phenomenon, the explanation for them is not the same in these three countries. Socioeconomic and situational factors are more important in Britain and Australia while political factors are more influential in the United States.},

The transposition of Western policy assumes that gender identities and interests in the East and the West are the same. The East-West tensions that persist over the ideas of gender and feminism suggest that such an assumption may be out of place. I discuss explicit sexual equality policies under communism, showing how, despite the limits to their success, sexual difference was nevertheless not experienced as the source of political inequality during the communist regime. Sexual equalization was rather the unintended consequence of state socialism, where political exclusion was defined in terms of society vis-a-vis the state. While existing EU policy has been oriented towards the exclusionary meaning that the public-private distinction has had in the West, in the communist countries political inequality was not defined in these terms. For eastern European countries, convergence with the West means not only the rise of masculinism, it means among other things - the rise of unemployment for both women and men, and the rise of class. One reason why sexual discrimination in the labour market may not have priority among eastern European women's concerns is that a starker comparison is between the unemployment of both sexes now, as compared with the full employment of both sexes in the past.},

A multilevel study of 279 066 respondents to the Current Population Survey (CPS) was conducted. State-level inequality in voting turnout by socioeconomic status (family income and educational attainment) was derived from November CPS data for 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996. Results. Individuals living in the states with the highest voting inequality had an odds ratio of fair/poor self-rated health of 1.43 (95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.22, 1.68) compared with individuals living in the states with the lowest voting inequality This odds ratio decreased to 1.34 (95\% CI=1.14, 1.56) when state income inequality was: added and to 1.27 (95\% CI=1.10, 1.45) when state median income was included. The deleterious effect of low individual household income on self-rated health was most pronounced among states with die greatest voting and income inequality. Conclusions. Socioeconomic inequality in political participation (as measured by voter turnout) is associated with poor self-rated health, independently of both income inequality and state median household income.},

When median-class voters a priori favor redistributive policies, a strategic privatization program allocating them enough shares can induce a voting shift away from left-wing parties whose policy would reduce the value of shareholdings. To induce median-class voters to buy enough shares to shift political preferences, strategic rationing and underpricing is often necessary. In the extreme, this may lead to free share distribution and voucher privatization. Shifting voting preferences becomes impossible when strong ex ante political constraints require large upfront transfers to insiders or when social inequality is extreme.},

  abstract = {I review studies of national elections from 13 OECD countries over 30 years to examine the effect of declining or increasing Quality of Life (QOL) on citizens' voting behavior. The results are consistent with the theory that citizens hold the incumbent party responsible for increases or decreases in QOL during their term in office, and vote against an incumbent party that fails to deliver improved QOL. Studies show that this ``responsibility hypothesis'' holds not only for economic variables such as GDP/capita, but for murder rates, violent crime rates, nutrition, and inequality. The platform and qualification of candidates also has an effect on voting, but the macro-variables composing QOL occur prior to and act to shape the platform and strategy of candidates. These results hold important implications for constructing indexes of QOL, because researchers can use national voting behavior to recover the weights that voters use in combining domains of QOL. By using these weights from the `representative voter', researchers can create a unified index of QOL for social reports.},

Because those from advantaged backgrounds access the medium at higher rates, the opportunities to participate via the Internet should disproportionately extend to high-resource individuals. I argue that the focus on access has important theoretical limitations. If one accepts the future possibility of near-equal access, then explorations of the Internet's participatory potential should include theoretical guidance about what types of individuals would most likely participate if equal Internet access were achieved. Drawing on diverse literature, two expectations develop; one predicts the reinforcement of existing participation patterns, and the other suggests a change in those patterns to include new types of individuals. I empirically test these competing claims, concluding that given equalized access, the Internet shows genuine potential to bring new individuals into the political process.},

  abstract = {Using interview data and a content analysis of personal narratives, this article shows that the nostalgia exhibited by China's zhiqing generation in the 1990s emerged as a form of cultural resistance against the changing conditions of Chinese modernity. At the center of this collective nostalgia was a concern for meaning and identity newly problematized by the conditions of contemporary life. Under these conditions, among former educated youth, nostalgia becomes a means of identity construction. Nostalgia connects individuals to their past, compels them to articulate their generational experience in narratives, and contrasts a past viewed as containing beauty, meaning, and purpose with a present increasingly dominated by economic inequality and instrumental rationality. In its conclusion, the article suggests that the zhiqing nostalgia marks a shift in contemporary Chinese political life from a macropolitics of mass political campaigns to a micropolitics of social and cultural orientation.},

  abstract = {This pooled, cross-sectional, time-series study assesses the impact of health system variables on the relationship between wage inequality and infant mortality in 19 OECD countries over the period 1970-1996. Data are derived from the OECD, World Value Surveys, Luxembourg Income Study, and political economy databases. Analyses include Pearson correlation and fixed-effects multivariate regression. In year-specific and time-series analyses, the Theil measure of wage inequality (based on industrial sector wages) is positively and statistically significantly associated with infant mortality rates-even while controlling for GDP per capita. Health system variables-in particular the method of healthcare financing and the supply of physicians-significantly attenuated the effect of wage inequality on infant mortality. In fixed effects multivariate regression models controlling for GDP per capita and wage inequality, variables generally associated with better health include income per capita, the method of healthcare financing, and physicians per 1000 population. Alcohol consumption, the proportion of the population in unions, and government expenditures on health were associated with poorer health outcomes. Ambiguous effects were seen for the consumer price index, unemployment rates, the openness of the economy, and voting rates. This study provides international evidence for the impact of wage inequalities on infant mortality. Results suggest that improving aspects of the healthcare system may be one way to partially compensate for the negative effects of social inequalities on population health.

We conclude by identifying the aspects on which there is a relative consensus among scholars, the debates surrounding controversial conclusions obtained from different empirical analyses, and those questions where further research seems particularly necessary.},

  abstract = {We conducted an ecologic analysis of the relation between women's status and child well-being in the 50 United States. State-level women's status was assessed via four composite indices: women's political participation, economic autonomy, employment and earnings, and reproductive rights. Child well-being was measured via five outcomes: percentage of low birthweight babies, infant mortality, teen mortality, high school dropout rate, and teen birth rate. Higher state-level women's status on all indicators was associated with significantly better state-level child well-being in unadjusted analyses. Several associations remained significant after adjusting for income inequality and state racial composition. Women's political participation was associated with a significantly lower percentage of low birthweight babies (p \textexclamdown.001) and lower teen birth rates (p \textexclamdown.05). Women's employment and earnings was associated with lower infant mortality (p \textexclamdown.05) and teen birth rates (p \textexclamdown.05). More economic and social autonomy for women was associated with better child outcomes on all measures (p \textexclamdown.01 all). Greater reproductive rights were associated with significantly lower infant mortality (P \textexclamdown.01). We conclude that child well-being is worse in states where women have lower political, economic, and social status. Women's status is an important aspect of children's social context which may impact their well-being. Multi-level analyses of the association between state-level women's status and child well-being are needed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Under reasonable assumptions, the baseline model produces an equilibrium with the extent of redistributive taxation chosen by the median income earner. If the median is poorer than average, redistribution is from rich to poor, and increasing inequality increases redistribution. However, under different assumptions about the economic environment, redistribution may not be simply rich to poor, and inequality need not increase redistribution. Several lines of argument are presented, in particular, political participation, public provision of private goods, public pensions, and tax avoidance or evasion.},

  abstract = {This article, drawing on the results of both survey research and of ethnography in Delhi, Bangalore, and Chennai, concerns the relationships between the middle class and the informal working class in Indian cities in the sphere of civil society. These relationships are shown to be very significant in the definition of the ``middle class'' and a critical dimension of the reproduction of class relationships. They also demonstrate that civil society should not be abstracted from the field of class relations, in the way that characterizes some contemporary arguments about the potentials of civil organization. Civil society is shown to be distinctly stratified. On the whole it is a sphere of middle class activism, and such activism is one of the defining features of the middle class. Members of the informal working class, on the other hand, are largely excluded from active participation in civil society organizations, so that increasing opportunities for political participation through civil organization may be associated with increased political inequality. The exceptions to this general rule are sometimes interlinked movements for women's rights, for the rights of informal workers, and for rights to housing-in which women from the informal working class are notably active. The issues of housing and of rights to livelihood, however, frequently bring the middle class and the informal working class into contention. Politics is often the only resource available to informal workers and their valuation of electoral democracy is to be understood in this context.},

More specifically, it examines how marketization, which started in 1978, and democratization, which was initiated in 1987, together have influenced women's participation in local village elections. Based on qualitative information collected from interviews and focus groups conducted over a three-year period between 2002 and 2004, it is evident that although women's political participation is strong, there is gender inequality in political participation at this grassroots level. Further, political participation is mediated by interactions between the state, the community, and individual families.},

Republican candidates should receive their strongest electoral support in locations where occupations are highly segregated by sex and by race, particularly in settings where segregation is most vulnerable to penetration. The argument finds support in statistical analyses of county-level variation in Republican voting in the 2004 presidential election.},

The analysis suggests that the spatial structure of participation is consistent with a diffusion process that occurs independently from citizens' involvement in social networks.},

Where capitalism is coordinated, as in much of northern Europe, political systems are consensus-based with proportional representation (PR); consensus politics and coordinated capitalism reinforce each other in generating relatively low inequality and strong welfare states. Where capitalism is liberal - the Anglo-Saxon countries - political systems are competitive with majoritarian voting: mutual reinforcement of politics and capitalism generates relatively inegalitarian outcomes and safety-net welfare states. The second half of the article develops a model of hierarchical capitalism to show how this reinforces and is reinforced by a Latin American political system with majoritarian presidents and PR legislatures to generate high and persistent inequality and reduce development options.},

  abstract = {This article seeks to determine the main predictors of political participation in a newly democratic regime: Mexico. Compared to other nations, Mexico fills a moderate position in terms of the volume of political participation. Following the literature on participation, this study develops a set of participant modes-voting, communal activity, petitioning, direct action, and political organization membership-and then seeks to determine the socioeconomic, demographic, attitudinal, and social capital factors that best explain participation. Distinct resource inequalities limit the participation of the less educated, the poor, women, and workers, although peasant participation is robust. The strongest determinant of political participation of all kinds is involvement in social capital-generating activities: belonging to nonpolitical organizations and engaging in charitable work, activities typically dominated by the middle class. Building social capital is essential to promoting robust rates of political participation in Mexico.},

  abstract = {Various studies suggest that while institutionalised and electoral forms of political participation are in decline in Western societies, non-institutionalised forms of participation (like demonstrating, political consumerism or signing petitions) are on the rise. However, this expansion of the political action repertoire of citizens also entails the question of equal participation opportunities. It can be argued that contemporary ideals of democratic participation assume an equal representation of citizens' interests. In this article we analyse the equality of participation patterns using comparative data from the 2004 ISSP survey. Our results suggest that non-institutionalised forms of participation increase patterns of inequality due to education but strongly reduce or even reverse gender and age inequalities. As such, both institutionalised and non-institutionalised forms of participation have specific (dis)advantages from the perspective of preserving equal access to democratic decision-making procedures.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of the gender gap in politics tend to focus on candidate choice rather than registration and turnout. This shift in focus away from gender inequality in political participation may be due to the finding in several studies of U. S. voting behavior since 1980 that differences in rates of registration and voting between men and women are modest and not statistically significant after controlling for traditional predictors of participation. However, we argue that researchers have overlooked the substantial gender gap in registration and voting in the South. While the gender gap in participation virtually disappeared outside the South by the 1950s, substantial gender differences in rates of voter registration and turnout remained in the South throughout the 1950s and 1960s. We test several explanations for the persistence of the gender gap in registration and voting in the South in the 1950s and 1960s and why it began to decline in the 1970s. These explanations include female labor force participation, resources, mobilization, and political engagement. Using American National Election Studies data for every presidential election year from 1956 to 1980, we employ heteroscedastic probit models within a cross-classified multilevel age-period-cohort framework to examine the declining gender gap in voter registration and turnout in the South. The results indicate that the decline of the gender gap is due to converging rates of political engagement and employment for women and men in the South during this time period. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical implications.},

  abstract = {The aim of this article is to offer an empirical contribution to the debate on the political significance of class, and especially the relationship between class position and political participation. The `death of class' debate has primarily addressed only one aspect of politics - voting. The perspective offered here widens the scope of analysis to include the main forms of political action available to citizens in modern democracies.

The paper offers a theoretical characterization of Puerto Rican/Hispanic political participation that includes the elements of racialization, inequality, reliance on external resources, and a type of identity politics that mixes elements of minority and white political behavior. The paper suggests that, so long as Puerto Ricans/Hispanics continue to face socioeconomic and political inequality while simultaneously enjoying discrete opportunities to choose between Puerto Rican/Hispanic candidates, their political behavior will be both minority and white; minority to the extent it focuses on descriptive representation and white to the extent it takes descriptive representation for granted.},

  abstract = {We examine the interactions between individual behavior, sentiments and the social contract in a model of rational voting over redistribution. Agents have moral ``work values''. Individuals' self-esteem and social consideration of others are endogenously determined comparing behaviors to moral standards. Attitudes toward redistribution depend on self-interest and social preferences. We characterize the politico-economic equilibria in which sentiments, labor supply and redistribution are determined simultaneously. The equilibria feature different degrees of ``social cohesion'' and redistribution depending on pre-tax income inequality. In clustered equilibria the poor are held partly responsible for their low income since they work less than the moral standard and hence redistribution is low. The paper proposes a novel explanation for the emergence of different sentiments and social contracts across countries. The predictions appear broadly in line with well-documented differences between the United States and Europe. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This within-country analysis complements existing cross-country studies on the same subject. Using a detailed dataset to track civil war casualties across space and over time, several patterns are documented. Conflict-related deaths are significantly higher in poorer districts and in geographical locations that favor insurgents, such as mountains and forests; a 10 percentage point increase in poverty is associated with 25-27 additional conflict-related deaths. This result is similar to that documented in cross-country studies. In addition, the relationship with poverty and geography is similar for deaths caused by the insurgents and deaths caused by the state. Furthermore, poorer districts are likely to be drawn into the insurgency earlier, consistent with the theory that a lower cost of recruiting rebels is an important factor in starting conflict. On the other hand, geographic factors are not significantly associated with such onset, suggesting that they instead contribute to the intensity of violence only after conflict has started. Finally, in contrast to some cross-country analyses, ethnic and caste polarization, land inequality, and political participation are not significantly associated with violence.},

I then use the framework to reassess the relationship between inequality and redistribution. The model shows that, even though each contribution has a negligible impact, the interaction between contributions and voting leads to an endogenous wealth bias in the political process, as the advantage of wealthier individuals in providing contributions encourages parties to move their platforms closer to those individuals' preferred positions. This mechanism can in turn explain why the standard median-voter-based prediction, that more inequality produces more redistribution, has received little empirical support: higher inequality endogenously shifts the political system further in favor of the rich. In equilibrium, there is a non-monotonic relationship in which redistribution is initially increasing but eventually decreasing in inequality. I present some empirical evidence supporting the framework, using data on campaign contributions from US presidential elections. In particular, inequality increases contributions to Republicans, but not to Democrats, as predicted by the model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen increasing interest in internet voting in theory and practice. Proponents hope that modernizing the electoral process will boost turnout. Less optimistic scholars object that the new technology merely perpetuates existing patterns of participation. This study aims to arbitrate the controversy. New survey data from the 2007 general election in Estonia allow us to predict the usage of e-voting and its impact on electoral participation. We find that e-voting mostly affects `peripheral' citizens (in a demographic and political sense), but only few of these citizens vote online in the first place. Conversely, the impact on typical e-voters is low. This `bottleneck' effect explains why e-voting has failed to boost turnout but also points to a role in reducing political inequality.},

  abstract = {Previous research demonstrates that the belief in a just world is often accompanied by the justification of social inequality and by low socio-political participation (e. g., Jost and Hunyady, Curr Direct Psychol Sci 14:260-265, 2005). However, studies provide evidence that the relations may be moderated by individual differences such as a person's self-efficacy expectations to promote justice and equality (Mohiyeddini and Montada, Responses to victimization and belief in a just world, 1998). At the societal level, collective political efficacy has consistently been found to foster political participation (cf. Lee, Int J Public Opin Res 22:392-411, 2010). In our study, we tested whether collective political efficacy may attenuate the negative social impact of the belief in a just world: It is predicted that when collective political efficacy is low, a strong belief in a just world would increase the motivation to justify inequality. By contrast, when collective political efficacy is high, the belief in a just world would not increase, but potentially decrease the motivation to justify inequality. In turn, justification of inequality is expected to negatively affect socio-political participation. Data from 150 university students were analyzed using moderated structural equation modeling. In our study, the expected moderating effect of collective political efficacy on the relation between belief in a just world and justification of inequality was established empirically. When collective political efficacy was high, justification of inequality did not inevitably increase with the belief in a just world. In addition, the impact of belief in a just world on justice-promoting behavior was mediated by justification of inequality. Implications for theory and future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Few studies have measured gender inequality at levels lower than the country. We sought to develop neighbourhood indicators of gender inequality, and assess their ability to capture variability in gender inequality across Quebec, Canada. Methods: Aggregate 2001 census data for 11,564 neighbourhoods were obtained for men and women. Twelve indicators of gender inequality representing demographic/household characteristics, education, income, work/leisure, and political participation were selected. Neighbourhood-level gender inequality scores were computed for each indicator, and examined across parts of Quebec (metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities, rural areas). Monte Carlo simulations were used to assess the ability of indicators to capture heterogeneity in gender inequality across neighbourhoods. Results: Male-dominant neighbourhood-level gender inequality tended to be present for average employment income, labour force participation, employment rate, and employment in managerial positions. Female-dominant gender inequality tended to be present for divorce, single-headed households, and participation in unpaid housework, child and elderly care. Neighbourhood-level gender inequality tended to vary across metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities, and rural areas. Gender inequality scores also varied within these geographic areas. For example, there was greater income-related gender inequality in high than low income neighbourhoods. Monte Carlo simulations suggested that the variation in gender inequality across neighbourhoods was greater than expected with chance alone. Conclusion: Neighbourhood-level gender inequality tended to be present in Quebec, and varied across parts of the province. Greater awareness of and research on neighbourhood-level gender inequality may be warranted to inform gender policies in Quebec and other nations.},

Previous studies have documented a robust congruence between aggregated public opinion and public policies in the American states. However, an equally important question for evaluating the quality of democracy is ``Who does government respond to when formulating public policies?'' I investigate differential policy representation based on citizens' household incomes and find that citizens with low incomes receive little substantive political representation (compared with more affluent citizens) in the policy decisions made by their state governments. This unequal policy representation occurs for both the general liberalism of state policies and on specific social issues like the death penalty and abortion. These findings suggest that examining the variation in political inequality across the 50 states can help scholars to better understand and explain ``unequal democracy'' in the United States.},

  abstract = {Kenya has been going through a period of political reform since 1991, when section 2A of the constitution, which had made Kenya a de jure one-party state, was repealed. This reform followed a prolonged struggle on the part of citizens both inside and outside the country, and their call for democracy was one that, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, was embraced by Western countries. Via diplomatic pressure and conditionality on aid, Western donors played an important role in the repeal of section 2A, the return of multiparty elections, and the creation and reform of a number of political institutions and offices via a separation of powers. But although these changes were supported by the political opposition and much of civil society in Kenya, they did not rise organically from the national struggle over political power. Nor did these reforms lead to a determination in the country to hold the political elite accountable for their transgressions. This article argues that modern Kenya's history of economic and political inequality has resulted in a population whose very divisions make it difficult for politicians to be disciplined. Accountability has two dimensions: the horizontal accountability among branches of government that is assured by checks and balances, and the vertical accountability of the state to its citizens. Vertical accountability depends on a constituency of like-minded citizens defending broad national interests, or an electorate with a collective identity or set of identities attached to the Kenyan nation. But in the absence of such shared goals and demands, narrow personal and local interests prevail, and politicians remain unaccountable to the nation as a whole.},

However, only limited research examines the relationship between gender equality and alcohol consumption. This study examined associations between five measures of state-level gender equality and five alcohol consumption measures in the United States. Survey data regarding men's and women's alcohol consumption from the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were linked to state-level indicators of gender equality. Gender equality indicators included state-level women's socioeconomic status, gender equality in socioeconomic status, reproductive rights, policies relating to violence against women, and women's political participation. Alcohol consumption measures included past 30-day drinker status, drinking frequency, binge drinking, volume, and risky drinking. Other than drinker status, consumption is measured for drinkers only. Multi-level linear and logistic regression models adjusted for individual demographics as well as state-level income inequality, median income, and \% Evangelical Protestant/Mormon. All gender equality indicators were positively associated with both women's and men's drinker status in models adjusting only for individual-level covariates; associations were not significant in models adjusting for other state-level characteristics. All other associations between gender equality and alcohol consumption were either negative or non-significant for both women and men in models adjusting for other state-level factors. Findings do not support the hypothesis that higher levels of gender equality are associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption by women or by men. In fact, most significant findings suggest that higher levels of equality are associated with less alcohol consumption overall. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These issues are examined by applying structural equation modeling to a longitudinal panel of youth.

For each group, parental political socialization: discussion predicted youths' commitment to produce social change and for two groups, longitudinally predicted political participation. This study contributes to the literature by examining civic/political participation among disparate racial/ethnic groups, addresses an open scholarly question (whether youths' commitment to create social change predicts their ``traditional'' participation), and emphasizes parents' role in fostering marginalized youths' civic and political participation.},

  abstract = {This article compares the political representation of visible minorities in Canada and the United States, focusing on differences in federal redistribution (redistricting) practices and constituency composition. Although the two countries both use territorially-based electoral systems, they operate under different legal standards and institutional environments for the creation of ridings (districts). In the US, redistricting is a highly political process, yet must respect strict population equality standards. Litigation over redistricting is common, and courts adjudicate voting and representation under a constitutional system enforcing strong individual rights. In contrast, Canada's redistribution process is relatively nonpartisan, permits large population variances among ridings, places more emphasis on community rights, and is seldom subject to extensive court challenges. Despite these differences, the two countries exhibit striking similarities in the overall level of visible minority representation relative to population share. Conversely, Canada's population inequalities among ridings create a systematic disadvantage for visible minorities. Political attention to visible minority representation is stronger in the US, but the means to achieve it are constrained both by the judicial limits on group representation and the constitutional limits on the use of racial identity. Canada has a framework for political representation that could easily accommodate significant visible minority representation but lacks the political imperative to use it, in part because doing so would run counter to Canada's multicultural image of these groups as immigrants rather than as non-white minorities.},

We take these two traditions in order to study digital political participation. However, rather than doing so in order to explain activism, which is usually the case, we seek to explain a specific type of inequality in the information and knowledge society: the political digital divide. Given that digital political participation takes place through a medium that is not universally used, namely the Internet, it is important to know which citizens are in a position to opt for the advantages the political use of this medium represents. Studies exist analysing the way in which the political digital divide appears in terms of sociodemographic and attitudinal variables. Here, however, we try to present a model that helps us understand how these two groups of variables relate in terms of the relationship to digital political participation. The aim is to offer a fuller perspective of the sources of digital political inequalities.},

Using data from the National Election Study, we compared trends for youth and older adults of varying education levels and tested the hypothesis of an increasing educational disparity in youth political participation. Results for voting supported our expectations: declines over time were found for less-educated youth only. Unexpectedly, participation in other political activities for more-educated youth declined more overtime compared to other groups. Our findings highlight the need to create equal opportunities for youth civic engagement across social groups.},

Second, we evaluate whether there is an association between the two concepts in a larger, more representative sample of democratic elections around the world. Third, we analyze if income inequality has a different influence on participation in the Western and non-Western countries. Controlling for nine theoretically informed covariates, we assess these claims in a multilevel framework with evidence from more than 550 democratic elections between 1970 and 2010. We find little evidence that electoral turnout is affected by income inequality. Our results also indicate that this ``null'' effect does not differ between the Western- and the non-Western world. However, we do find evidence that mandatory voting laws and more decisive elections boost turnout considerably. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In comparative terms, Italian electoral turnout has been very high since 1946. However, during the five elections from 1994 to 2008. turnout dropped more steeply than it did over the previous 12 elections from 1946 to 1992. The difference between maximum turnout in the early 1950s and the 2008 election was about 12\%. and most of this decline (8\%) occurred in the period 1992-2008. This paper finds robust evidence that individual and contextual social inequalities have been key factors in the recent fall of turnout. In particular our results clearly suggest that contextual social inequality lowers the turnout of less-educated voters and leaves it unaffected among high-educated ones. The recent decline in turnout may therefore be indicative of an important shift towards more unequal political participation. These findings are consistent with data showing that the post-1994 parties performed very poorly as mobilisation agencies compared with the old parties. Indeed, according to Franklin (2004), turnout trends can be effectively explained by changes in institutional rules and by the degree of electoral competitiveness. This paper suggests that, in order to explain turnout trends, the interactive effects of social and individual inequality should also be considered.

  abstract = {Hunter-gatherer societies are often characterized by limited complexity and social equality. Therefore, the construction of monumental architecture by hunter-gatherers is seen as the manifestation of social and political inequality. The massive size and rapid construction of Mound A at Poverty Point (ca. 3261 cal. yr B.P.) in northeast Louisiana challenges these notions. Geoarchaeological investigations of stratigraphy at the macro- and micro-levels shows there are no erosion events, natural episodes of soil formation, or cultural stages. We infer from these results that Mound A was constructed by a large labor force over a short period of time. There is no evidence, however, that the mound was constructed under the aegis of a ranked socio-political system. We argue instead that the mound was constructed as a ritual feature and that leadership required to mobilize labor and resources was situational and emerged through ritual practice that developed because of the need to integrate a large population.

  abstract = {Objective: We investigated the association between income inequality and social capital with measles-containing vaccine (MCV) coverage rates in Japan. Methods: MCV coverage data for all 1750 municipalities were collected from statistics publicized by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of japan in 2010. Prefectural Gini coefficients in 2009 (an indicator of income inequality) and social capital indicators (including voting rates, volunteer rates at the prefectural level, and move-in ratios at the municipal level) were linked to MCV coverage using a multi-level analysis adjusting for covariates (population, age distribution, average income, average number of household members). Results: Coverage of the first dose of MCV (MCV1), and second dose (MCV2), decreased by 3.98\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-7.71) and 4.28\% (95\% CI: 0.60-7.60) per each 0.1-unit increase in Gini coefficients within large municipalities (with a population 50,000 or more), respectively. Conversely, coverage of MCV2 increased by 0.26\% (95\% CI: 0.08-0.45) per 1\% increase in voting rate within large municipalities. Volunteer rates were inversely associated with MCV2 coverage within large municipalities. Move-in ratios at the municipal level were inversely associated with MCV2 coverage within medium-sized municipalities (with a population between 10,000 and 50,000). Conclusions: While higher income inequality at a prefectural level was associated with lower MCV coverage rates, higher social capital was associated with higher coverage in large municipalities. To enhance MCV coverage in Japan, we recommend that income inequality be addressed and social capital boosted at the prefectural level. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Although clear patterns of inequality according to racial group membership have been found regarding political participation, the extent to which such inequalities are also seen in public definitions of citizenship is unclear. Using the 2004 US General Social Survey, we examine respondents' beliefs about citizenship duties and rights. Starting from theories on group membership and self-interest, and given the unequal access to full citizenship inherent in the United States, we hypothesize more support for citizenship as a duty among Whites, but more support for democratic rights among non-Whites. The findings of our multivariate analyses show that support for these expectations is mixed. Whites and non-Whites do not differ in the importance they place on citizenship duties. However, non-Whites are significantly more likely to support citizenship rights. The difference is partly explained by non-Whites' greater likelihood of identifying with the Democratic Party.

  abstract = {Despite extensive research on voting, there is little evidence connecting turnout to tangible outcomes. Would election results and public policy be different if everyone voted? The adoption of compulsory voting in Australia provides a rare opportunity to address this question. First, I collect two novel data sources to assess the extent of turnout inequality in Australia before compulsory voting. Overwhelmingly, wealthy citizens voted more than their working-class counterparts. Next, exploiting the differential adoption of compulsory voting across states, I find that the policy increased voter turnout by 24 percentage points which in turn increased the vote shares and seat shares of the Labor Party by 7-10 percentage points. Finally, comparing across OECD countries, I find that Australia's adoption of compulsory voting significantly increased turnout and pension spending at the national level. Results suggest that democracies with voluntary voting do not represent the preferences of all citizens. Instead, increased voter turnout can dramatically alter election outcomes and resulting public policies.},

Whereas there are numerous studies of the reenfranchisement of African Americans in the South in the literature, temporal changes in the gender gap in southern political participation have received less attention. Gender inequality in voting has historically been greatest in the South and was more resistant to change over time. This study is the first to examine the intersection of gender and racial inequality in political participation in the South over a period spanning several decades. Building on previous theories of political participation, including the civic voluntarism model and the strategic mobilization perspective, we develop and test a conceptual model based on the interplay between individual characteristics and the broader institutional context. Using data from the American National Election Studies, we examine racial differences in the gender gap in southern political participation over time using hierarchical age-period-cohort analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical implications for the study of gender and racial inequality in political participation.},

  abstract = {For nearly two centuries the United States was a democracy that institutionalized in law inequality between racially defined segments-of the population. This article shows that such racial closure was causally linked to the workings of a party system in which one party was organized as an interregional alliance for the principles and practices of white supremacy. It does so through a detailed analysis of three historical outcomes: (1) variation in the establishment of racial closure laws across the North during the antebellum period, (2) the elimination of racial closure laws in the North after the Civil War, and (3) the failed attempt in the postbellum South to overcome racial closure in voting. Throughout the analysis of these three outcomes, the article shows that the party model conforms to the empirical record better than three major alternatives that emphasize the causal power of public opinion (electorate model), elite bargaining and consensus (elite model), and the racial preferences of the white working class (class model).},

Participation processes normally consolidate and intensify the exclusion of senior citizens having low incomes and low educational qualifications. In the research and development project ``Quality of Life of Elderly People in Living Quarters'' being conducted by Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, one of the questions being examined is whether and to what extent socially disadvantaged elderly people in a social space typical of the Ruhr region (reference area Gelsenkirchen-Schalke) can be included in the shaping of their quarter. This paper is based on the results of a quantitative, written survey (cross-section) on the subjects of quality of life and participation, and on a trend analysis measuring the effects of participation processes initiated on the elderly persons involved. The results of the study show that it is possible to involve socially disadvantaged elderly people in participation processes geared to the specific social space. They also indicate that elderly people from different income groups increase their social capital in the context of enabling structures.},

We experimentally investigate groups where a rich representative allocates resources among poorer members, who can announce disapproval by voting for a measure hurting the representative. We examine the effect of inequality aversion by keeping information on the allocation private in one and commonly known in another condition. Further, we investigate whether casting votes publicly or secretly influences allocation and voting behavior. We find that disapproval rates are highest with secret voting or a commonly known resource allocation. Disapproval voting fails to stimulate representatives to appear more prosocial, but rather induces them to keep everything. Private information on the allocation and public voting leads to least disapproval and exclusion of the poorest group members from the resources. The analysis shows that inequality aversion of poorer group members crucially interacts with the investigated institutional and informational details of the resource allocation situation.},

Using the Americas Barometer LAPOP 2010, I show, on one hand, that attitudes of political disaffection in Mexico are close to the regional mean and, on the other, I corroborate the theoretical postulate according to which individuals distinguish two dimensions of disaffection: political disengagement and institutional disaffection. I also demonstrate that the rational-culturalist model effectively explains the variations of both dimensions-as it allows for the interaction of socio-economic factors, rational evaluation and political identities-. Lastly, I find that political disengagement and institutional disaffection associate in a different way with political participation, access to information in the media, and perceptions on public security and corruption. These results confirm the premise that the dimensions of political disaffection represent a challenge to the quality of democracy in Mexico, as they reinforce social inequality, inhibit informed political participation and limit citizen control of institutions and politicians.},

This is still a nascent subfield, but the research community has come to general agreement on five key points: (1) at the mass behavioral level, the Internet has not changed fundamental participatory inequalities; (2) we have seen an increase in small-donor activity, and these donations tend to flow toward polarizing candidates; (3) for political campaign operations, ``mundane mobilization tools'' carry the largest impacts; (4) with political campaigns, the new focus on data analytics and the ``culture of testing'' is substantially changing resource expenditures and work routines; and (5) there is currently a clear partisan divide between how Democrats and Republicans employ digital technology for campaigning. The article also discusses the methodological challenges that separate Internet-related research from many of the more established fields of campaign finance-related research. It concludes by posing a set of research questions for the 2014 and 2016 election cycles which will likely prove fruitful.},

  abstract = {This study seeks to assess the implications of the social use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for online political participation. Past research investigating the link between ICTs and political participation has emphasized the informational use of ICTs, overlooking their communication-enabling potentials for facilitating political talk in interpersonal spaces and subsequently, political participation in public domains. To understand further how ICTs as a means of communication may relate to political participation, we use data from the 2008 Taiwan Social Change Survey (N=1076) to examine the relationship between the Internet and online political participation by looking at online media use for social interaction and engagement in civic talk online. Our findings suggest that interpersonal factors such as online civic talk and media multiplexity are positively associated with online political participation. Individuals who discuss politics with their friends via the Internet and those who use more types of online media for social interaction are more likely to contact legislators and elected officials directly via the Web and articulate their political thoughts in online public spaces such as forums, blogs, and websites of news media. We further offer an assessment of the findings' implications for political participation, political communication, and digital inequality.},

Muslim revivalist organizations and neo-Pentecostal churches in particular have established a range of health interventions that are tied to revisionist claims about religion, spirituality, and politics in society. In this article I discuss medical mission in Dar es Salaam in the light of (post)colonial histories of health service provision as well as with regard to inter- and intradenominational contestations over health and well-being, a morally acceptable life, and political participation. I argue that the nature of the inscription of revivalist organizations in urban space through health interventions depends on their structural location and their respective members' social and economic capital. I also show that the ongoing transformations of urban space through medical mission have become reflective of, as well as are triggering, moral interpretations of history and social inequality in contemporary Tanzania.},

The theoretical literature has treated these two channels separately, with natural resources affecting growth either through human capital or corruption. In this article, we argue that education and corruption are jointly determined and depend on the endowment of natural resources. Natural resources affect the incentives to invest in education and rent seeking that in turn affect growth. Whether natural resources stimulate growth or induce a poverty-trap crucially depends on inequality in access to education and political participation, as well as on the cost of political participation. For lower inequality and higher cost of political participation, a high-growth and a poverty-trap equilibrium coexist even with abundant natural resources.},

Our results suggest a strong, positive relationship between social media use and political engagement among young people across all three countries, and provide additional insights regarding the role played by social media use in the processes by which young people become politically engaged.

However, these increases may not be evenly distributed across the electorate and could potentially increase the differences between voters and nonvoters. By analyzing individual level-data, we reassess previous GOTV experiments to determine which interventions mobilize under-represented citizens versus those who regularly turn out. We develop a generalized and exportable test which indicates whether a particular intervention reduces or exacerbates disparities in political participation and apply it to 24 previous experimental interventions. On average, current mobilization strategies significantly widen disparities in participation by mobilizing high-propensity individuals more than the under-represented, low-propensity citizens. The results hold troubling implications for the study and improvement of political inequality, but the methodological procedures laid out in this study may assist the development and testing of future strategies which reverse this pattern.},

One of such Internet use is Digital Political Participation (DDP). In this paper we seek to understand how the influence of digital skills on the adoption of Digital Political Participation practices may form the basis of a second level of digital divide and of a set of political inequalities. We operationalize the digital skills construct in terms of users' Internet competence and level of appropriation. We hypothesize that digital skills have a significant influence on the adoption of beneficial uses of the Internet, such as DPP. At the same time, we examine whether digital skill levels are stratified by socio-demographic background, thereby generating political and social inequality. By looking at the Spanish case, we first tested the adequateness of the items chosen to measure these two dimensions. Second, we looked into sequences of multiple influences between socio-demographic variables and digital skills and between digital skills and DPP. The results show that socio demographic variables have an influence on digital skills. At the same time, digital skills have a strong influence on DPP.},

We examine political disintegration across eras, cultures and geographical scale to form a simple hypothesis that can be expressed verbally yet formulated mathematically. Factions within a state make choices described by game-theory about whether to accept the political status quo, or to attempt to better their circumstances through costly rebellion. In lieu of precise data we verify our model using sensitivity analysis. We find that a small amount of dissatisfaction is typically harmless to the state, but can trigger sudden collapse when there is a sufficient buildup of political inequality. Contrary to intuition, a state is predicted to be least stable when its leadership is at the height of its political power and thus most able to exert its influence through external warfare, lavish expense or autocratic decree.},

  abstract = {Studies of political participation typically analyze voting, contentious collective action, or membership in voluntary associations. Few scholars investigate a more mundane-but highly consequential-form of neighborhood politics: requests for basic city services. We conceptualize city service requests as a direct, instrumental contact with local government that alters the geographical distribution of public goods. We hypothesize that rates of service requests vary with the ethnic and immigrant composition of neighborhoods, due to differences in these communities' expectations of local government. We test this hypothesis using administrative data from the City of Boston. We find neighborhoods with high concentrations of first-generation immigrants less likely to request services, relative to need. The concentration of African Americans, however, is associated with large increases in neighborhood service requests. We conclude with implications for the study of race, inequality, and political incorporation.},

  abstract = {Scholars studying democracy are just beginning to investigate the specifically political consequences of rising socio-economic inequalities. This paper analyses whether the degree of political inequality between social groups is shaped by features of the welfare capitalist system. Specifically, we hypothesize that more labour protection and social support decrease participatory inequality via more evenly distributed resources and engagement between high-and low educated citizens. Our regression analyses combining micro-and macro-level data from 37 capitalist democracies over the past 20 years provide evidence that some protective and supportive elements of welfare capitalism reduce education-based participatory inequality. Our fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis identifies three functionally equivalent types of welfare capitalism that all produce low participatory inequality via increased protection, support or both. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that the mechanisms behind this link are, indeed, a more equal distribution of resources and engagement across low-and high educated citizens.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Despite the recognized importance of social determinants of health (SDH) in India, no compilation of the status of and inequities in SDH across India has been published. To address this gap, we assessed the levels and trends in major SDH in India from 1990 onwards and explored inequities by state, gender, caste, and urbanicity. Methods: Household-and individual-level SDH indicators were extracted from national household surveys conducted between 1990 and 2011 and means were computed across population subgroups and over time. The multidimensional poverty index (MPI), a composite measure of health, education, and standard of living, was calculated for all three rounds of the National Family Health Survey, adjusting the methodology to generate comparable findings from the three datasets. Data from government agencies were analyzed to assess voting patterns, political participation, and air and water pollution. Results: Changes in the MPI demonstrate progress in each domain over time, but high rates persist in important areas: the majority of households in India use indoor biomass fuel and have unimproved sanitation, and over one-third of households with a child under the age of 3 years have undernourished children. There are large, but narrowing, gender gaps in education indicators, but no measurable change in women's participation in governance or the labor force. Less than 25\% of workers have job security and fewer than 15\% have any social security benefit. Alarming rates of air pollution are observed, with particulate matter concentrations persistently above the critical level at over 50\% of monitoring stations. Conclusions: This assessment indicates that air pollution (indoor and outdoor), child undernutrition, unimproved sanitation, employment conditions, and gender inequality are priority areas for public policy related to SDH in India.},

An important study examining misreporting of voter turnout in opinion surveys, however, calls into question the true extent of participation inequality. Ansolabehere and Hersh's first-ever 50-state vote validation project shows that those with more political resources are more likely to misreport turnout. That is, those with higher incomes are more likely than others to report that they had voted when in fact they did not. These findings suggest that income disparities in participation are not as large as opinion surveys have led us to believe. Moreover, studies using differences between voters and nonvoters as a key political indicator may also be biased. This article presents the first assessment of whether vote misreporting creates systematic bias in measures of state participation inequality. An index of economic inequality in participation for the 50 states is developed using the Ansolabehere and Hersh validated vote data and compares the measure of political inequality with a similar measure using traditional (i.e., nonvalidated) survey data. These state indices are used to determine the extent of bias produced by misreporting and whether this bias has implications for studies using these measures of participation inequality. The latter is assessed by examining the influence of the self-reported and validated inequality measures on state welfare programs and minimum wage policy.},

Under this assumption, median income and the equally distributed equivalent income are the same, and the Gini coefficient is an affine function of the median-mean ratio. Despite the importance of these findings, the empirical plausibility of the symmetry hypothesis has not been tested yet. In this article, we contrast the symmetry assumption with an empirical exercise based on the Survey on Income and Living Conditions data set for the European Union in the period 2005-2007. We find that the symmetric condition is generally fulfilled.},

  abstract = {The struggle for Native American voting rights has lasted more than two centuries. Although the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act granted citizenship to indigenous peoples born within the geographic boundaries of the United States, it did not ensure the right to vote. Because the Constitution gives states the power to determine the times, places, and manner of holding elections, many states statutorily denied Native Americans the franchise until federal lawsuits forced them to change. Having the statutory right to vote, however, did not ensure that it could be exercised in a meaningful way. Since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act there have been more than ninety voting rights cases involving Native Americans. While the overall historical trend has been toward extending the vote, periods of enhanced voting rights often have been followed by periods of retrenchment. In this article, we argue that the traditional frameworks used to explain racial inequalities fail to account for the unique character of relations between indigenous peoples and the U.S. government, and we propose a tripartite approach that draws from studies in core-periphery development and racial institutional orders, but also considers the many ways that tribal identities intersect with these.},

More specifically, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that analyzes how income inequality interacts with individuals' income position in explaining citizens' involvement in conventional and unconventional political activities. The core of the paper focuses on a multilevel mixed-effects empirical analysis carried out on survey data collected by the European Values Study project; its results support the hypothesis that income inequality significantly shapes the effect of household income in determining citizens' forms of political engagement.},

It is shown that this difference completely shapes the pattern of trade. Trade, in turn, affects the distribution of human capital both at extensive and at intensive margins, income distribution, and welfare in each country. Since not all agents gain from trade, the paper also investigates the conditions under which trade between two countries becomes possible if the final decision in each country is based on majority voting. Finally, the paper shows that lowering the cost of human capital in one country has asymmetric effects on human capital formation and the income inequality between skilled and unskilled workers across countries.},

  abstract = {Many competitions, such as political campaigns, innovative endeavors, sports, or courting rituals, require investment of nonrefundable resources: One contestant wins the prize for the invested amount, whereas all others lose their investments without receiving compensation. Frequently, contests are asymmetric, because of differing resources or prize valuations. Does asymmetry discourage the weaker contestants from investing? Do stronger contestants take this into account and also invest less? Or does the desire to win abolish these differences? Two experiments explored the effects of asymmetry between the contestantsarising from their resources or prizeson nonrefundable investments. Subjects repeatedly competed in both symmetric and asymmetric contests, enabling within-subject comparisons. We observed an effect of asymmetry only when it concerned resources: Subjects overall invested less when their resources were unequal, whereas inequality in the prizes did not influence investments. This pattern suggests that winning itself is motivating. The changes between consecutive investments can be explained by reactions to the previous outcome (win or loss): Across all contests, investment decreased following a win and increased following a loss.

  abstract = {In 2008 Bhutan inaugurated a written constitution thereby instituting the state as a constitutional monarchy. The constitution is almost unanimously described as democratic by international media and academics. The ease with which this apparent consensus on its democratic character has been achieved, however, raises the important question of how best to approach the theory of constitutional democratization. In approaching the issue of democratization as a move towards popular control, this article discusses the ambivalence of the Bhutanese constitution towards this principle in a cultural context where social order is seen as constituted within the unity of king, country, and people. Curiously, this language is not as unique to Bhutan as one might expect, but influenced by the Westminster legacy in its emphasis on the principle of Crown in Parliament, its ritualization, and ideas of political inequality. It raises the question whether this model is suitable as a blueprint model for countries with different historic and cultural trajectories from the European ones? The article advocates a novel approach to the analysis of constitutional transition that transgresses the dichotomy between an institutional and linguistic approach, thus opening up interesting new insights on the waxing and waning of processes of expanding popular control.},

  abstract = {Over the past four decades, the criminal justice system has emerged as a key institution structuring social, economic, and political inequalities in the United States. Among individuals with felony records, the lack of political participation resulting from legal and non-legal barriers has likely altered election outcomes and has critical implications for our democratic principles. However, the focus on individuals may underestimate the reverberating consequences of diminished political participation. In this article, I propose that criminal justice contact, and specifically incarceration, diminishes political behavior among not only formerly incarcerated individuals but also their romantic partners. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing survey, I find that partner incarceration is associated with reduced political participation that is not explained by socioeconomic characteristics and is robust to different modeling approaches. Diminished participation is not due to a partner's influence or a lack of financial resources. It is also not one aspect of broad withdrawal from civic and religious domains. Rather, reduced political participation is a specific retreat from government. I suggest that these findings align with political socialization, where lessons about government are learned through interactions and experiences with the criminal justice system.},

  abstract = {Political inequality refers to the unequal influence over decisions made by political bodies and the unequal outcomes of those decisions. Political inequality is a subtype of power inequality, visible within the political processes of all kinds of political structures. In modern democracies, political inequality is simultaneously a dimension of democracy and a dimension of stratification. Two key theoretical and empirical questions are How much political inequality is there? and is political inequality rising, falling, or staying the same? The answer to these key questions requires us to specify the kind of political inequality voice, response, and their subtypes - and whether we mean equality of political opportunities or of political outcomes. I argue that we need to understand better the form, duration, and magnitude of political inequality within and across nations. We need to study it systematically, continuously, and diligently, and in an inclusive, open-minded way, inclining our ears to the varied contributions of the many academic disciplines. We should begin by studying political inequality as an international phenomenon and as an interdisciplinary enterprise, and from an intersectional approach.},

  abstract = {This article performs exploratory research using a mixed-methods approach (structural equation modelling and a thematic analysis of interview data) to analyse the ways in which socioeconomic disparities in voting patterns are reproduced through inequalities in education in different national contexts, and the role of self-efficacy in this process. The evidence suggests that in Germany and England students with lower socioeconomic status (SES) have lower levels of general self-efficacy, and that this is reinforced through early experiences of inequalities in the education system, such as within- or between-school selection. Low levels of general self-efficacy are then found to reduce political self-efficacy and voting intentions. In Germany and England, it is these students who enter initial vocational education and training (IVET). The experience of IVET then reinforces the distinctions in civic engagement, probably either through peer socialisation and/or curriculum differences. In Denmark, where SES has a weaker association with track placement, the experience of being placed in IVET plays a stronger role in reducing political self-efficacy and voting intentions.},

Using multilevel models of data from four waves of the European Social Survey, this article examines whether differences in inequality across countries and over time help explain people's engagement in peaceful protest.

This result provides strong support for the relative power theory of political participation; the predictions of grievance and resource theories regarding inequality's effects on protest are not supported.},

I argue, drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's work on ``political competence,'' that social position in the form of income also structures political participation through differences in the sense that one is a legitimate producer of political opinions. I test whether income differences in participation persist net of costs by examining nonparticipation in a setting in which barriers to participation are low: answering political survey questions. Lower-income people are more likely than others to withhold political opinions by saying ``don't know'' net of differences in education, ``cognitive ability,'' or engagement with the survey exercise. Further, political ``don't know'' rates predict voting rates, net of other predictors. Efforts to democratize participation in American politics must attend not only to the costs of involvement but also to class-based differences in individuals' relationship to political expression itself.},

However, if chronic illnesses-already unequally distributed in society are associated with differential rates of voter turnout, then these inequalities in democratic representation could, in turn, produce further health inequity. In this study, we use data from eight states from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey to examine the associations between having diagnoses of five chronic conditions and turnout in the 2008 US presidential election. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and some health-related confounding factors, we find that individuals with cancer diagnoses are more likely to vote, while those with heart disease diagnoses are less likely to vote. These associations differ by race and educational status; notably, African Americans and those with lower education with cancer are even more likely to turn out to vote than whites and those with more education with cancer. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of health social movements and the role of health organizations in shaping political processes, important directions for the study of health politics.},

The second is the inverse power problem: the problem of finding voting systems that approximate equal indirect voting power as well as possible. I argue that the coefficient of variation is appropriate to measure the inequality of a voting system and to specify the inverse problem. I then show how specifying the inverse problem with the coefficient of variation compares to using existing objective functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The two redistributive policies are determined by voting, while private education, which supplements public education, is purchased individually. The model, which includes two-dimensional voting, yields the following two types of stable, steady-state equilibria: a high-inequality equilibrium with government expenditures favoring lump-sum transfers or a low-inequality equilibrium with such expenditures favoring public education.},

  abstract = {Social exclusion and inclusion from groups, as well as the distribution of resources, are fundamental aspects of social life, and serve as sources of conflicts that bear on issues of fairness and equality, beginning in childhood. For the most part, research on social exclusion and allocation of resources has not focused on the issue of group membership. Yet, social exclusion from groups and the denial of resources reflect societal issues pertaining to social inequality and its counterpoint, fair treatment of others. Social inequality occurs when opportunities and resources are distributed unevenly in society, often through group norms about allocation that reflect socially defined categories of persons. This occurs at multiple levels of societal organization, from experiences of exclusion in childhood such as being left out of a play activity, to being denied access to resources as a member of a group. These situations extend to larger-level experiences in the adult world concerning social exclusion from voting, for example, or participation in educational institutions. Thus, most decisions regarding social exclusion and the denial of resources involve considerations of group identity and group membership, implicitly or explicitly, which contribute to prejudice and bias, even though this has rarely been investigated in developmental science. Current research illustrating the role of group identity and autonomy regarding decision-making about social exclusion and the denial of resources is reviewed from the social reasoning developmental model, a theoretical perspective that integrates social domain theory and developmental social identity theories to investigate how children use moral, conventional, and psychological judgments to evaluate contexts reflecting group identity, group norms, and intergroup dynamics.

  abstract = {Unequal turnout, namely that educated citizens are more likely to vote, has been a long-standing preoccupation of scholars of political participation and has been shown to exist across established democracies in varying degrees. Using pooled cross-sectional individual level data covering the period from 1990 to 2007 across 12 post-communist new democracies, this paper examines the applicability of existing explanations for unequal turnout in the Eastern European context. The paper shows that while voting procedures explain some cross-national variation in unequal turnout, turnout inequality is likewise shaped over time by processes related to the transition from communism, primarily the fading of initial excitement with democratic elections. The mechanism of learning among mature voters rather than generational replacement dominates the latter process. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Various studies on the topic have looked at the effects of the life cycle on political participation by using age as a proxy. Participation, however, may not be simply dependent on age. Instead, it may be related to the roles individuals assume during the life course. For this reason, the article looks at how participation changes during specific life transitions, such as leaving the parental home, forming a union and becoming a parent. Furthermore, the article puts special emphasis on how `private inequalities' in the household may become `political inequalities'. In fact, family roles and responsibilities can be constraints to participation, especially for women. The article finds that while leaving the parental home is positively associated with participation for both men and women, forming a union and being a parent is detrimental to the participation of women, but not to that of men.},

  abstract = {Background: In the United States, disparities in health literacy parallel disparities in health outcomes. Our research contributes to how diverse indicators of social inequalities (i.e., objective social class, relational social class, and social resources) contribute to understanding disparities in health literacy. Methods: We analyze data on respondents 18 years of age and older (N = 14,592) from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) restricted access data set. A series of weighted Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models estimate the association between respondent's demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status (SES), relational social class, social resources and an Item Response Theory (IRT) based health literacy measure. Results: Our findings are consistent with previous research on the social and SES determinants of health literacy. However, our findings reveal the importance of relational social status for understanding health literacy disparities in the United States. Objective indicators of social status are persistent and robust indicators of health literacy. Measures of relational social status such as civic engagement (i.e., voting, volunteering, and library use) are associated with higher health literacy levels net of objective resources. Social resources including speaking English and marital status are associated with higher health literacy levels. Conclusions: Relational indicators of social class are related to health literacy independent of objective social class indicators. Civic literacy ( e.g., voting and volunteering) are predictors of health literacy and offer opportunities for health intervention. Our findings support the notion that health literacy is a social construct and suggest the need to develop a theoretically driven conceptual definition of health literacy that includes a civic literacy component.},

Building on the finding of class-biased economic voting in the United States, we examine how electorates in advanced democracies respond to alternative distributions of income gains and losses. Drawing on individual-level electoral data and aggregate election results across 15 countries, we examine whether lower- and middle-income voters defend their distributive interests by punishing governments for concentrating income gains among the rich. We find no indication that non-rich voters punish rising inequality and substantial evidence that electorates positively reward the concentration of aggregate income growth at the top. Our results suggest that governments commonly face political incentives systematically skewed in favor of inegalitarian economic outcomes. At the same time, we find that the electorate's tolerance of rising inequality has its limits: class biases in economic voting diminish as the income shares of the rich grow in magnitude.},

It relies upon the salience of pluralism over political inequality, but these conditions are now inverted. The current salience of political inequality is the chief characteristic of unequalocracy, a political system type intermediate between polyarchy and plutocracy. Contrary to Gilens and Bartels, the US has not been demonstrated to have enough representational inequality to be a plutocracy. Using an alternative conception of what constitutes preference differences between high-and lowincome groups, and applying it to Gilens' own data, I find too few preference differences to show plutocracy exits in the US.},

Since the beginning of their transition to democracy and up to the present day, both nations share an increase in aspirations to equality while they differ regarding the strategies to reach it. Whereas political culture in Chile tends towards state intervention in distributive matters and non-conventional political participation, Mexico is undergoing a moment in which both satisfactions with democracy and support for it are declining, and formal and informal political participation have weakened. In this scenario, the search for equality privileges competition and large income differentials as incentives to reach it, features that ultimately legitimize inequality and evidence a much more individualized and less democratic society than the Chilean one.},

Reformers often argue that the low salaries paid in state and local governments make holding office economically infeasible for lower-income citizens and contribute to the enduring numerical under-representation of the working class in our political institutions. Of course, raising politicians' salaries could also make political office more attractive to affluent professionals, increasing competition for office and ultimately discouraging lower-income citizens from running and winning. In this article, we test these hypotheses using data on the salaries and economic backgrounds of state legislators. Contrary to the notion that paying politicians more promotes economic diversity, we find that the descriptive representation of the working class is the same or worse in states that pay legislators higher salaries. These findings have important implications for research on descriptive representation, political compensation, and political inequality.},

  abstract = {Drawing on the contributions from the World Social Science Report 2016, Challenging Inequalities: Pathways to a Just World, this article examines the relationship between economic inequality and political participation. In particular, using the lens of the `power cube' approach (www.powercube.net), we argue that understanding the impact of inequality on political participation requires moving beyond the study of its impact on more conventional forms of participation found in voting and `voice' through established or formal democratic processes. Indeed, this relationship is also influenced by hidden and invisible forms of power, at multiple levels from the local to the global, which affect the rules of the game as well as individuals' aspiration to participate, shaping whether, where and how citizens engage at all. Despite the power of inequality to shape its own consensus, recent evidence also points to the emergence of levels and forms of resistance to inequality outside of traditional channels of participation, which in turn help to expand and prefigure notions of what the new possibilities of change might be. Exploring these dynamics, the article concludes with a brief reflection on possible lessons for activists, policymakers and scholars working to understand, unravel and challenge the knotty intersections of inequality, power and participation.},

  abstract = {Why are some people more responsive to campaign mobilization than others? I argue that the composition of a person's core personality makes some people more responsive to mobilization cues than others. However, the degree to which personality alters the effectiveness of mobilization also depends on the type of political participation for which people are being mobilized. I explore the determinants of political participation by looking at the interaction between the Big-5 traits of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability and the intensity of campaign environments. This paper demonstrates that despite the possible ameliorative effect mobilization has on unequal patterns of political participation, an enduring source of participatory inequality may very well be rooted in a person's core psychological structure.

  abstract = {This paper seeks to contribute to the debate over the efficacy of voluntary agreements versus regulation, and uses a study of the Livable Housing Design initiative to deliver voluntarily new-built accessible housing in Australia. We first probe why regulation has become such a significant component of government policy making, and then ask why political campaigns focus on this issue as a strategy for reform. We refer to research by disability activists, which claims that the voluntary approach has failed and regulation is necessary. Amongst our conclusions are: (1) that the disjuncture between policy rhetoric and outcome can be attributed to the power of lobbyists, reliance on the private market to address inequality, and antipathy to regulatory enforcement; and (2) that there is a need for greater interrogation of the language deployed in policy texts to identify whether they are crafted to maintain the government's legitimacy or to deliver purposeful change. The paper considers the disjuncture between government policy rhetoric to increase the supply of accessible housing and outcomes. Government failure can be sourced to the hegemony of private market ideology and aversion to regulation. A purposeful and incisive critique of government policymaking is the first step to effective interventions},

First, under communism, associational life was neither extinct nor always totally controlled by the state. Over time, some organizations achieved a modicum of autonomy. The massive Solidarity movement left a legacy of civic engagement that influenced post-1989 developments. Second, inequality under state socialism needs to be treated comprehensively. While the level of income inequality was modest, economic inequality was more pronounced (privileges of the communist elites). Civic and political inequalities were acute. All three forms of inequality generated discontent and mobilization. Third, after 1989, civil society has become an institutional vehicle for virtually eliminating political inequality, advancing civic equality, and controlling the growth of economic inequality.},

  abstract = {Does social media reinforce or transcend socioeconomic divides in political participation? The mobilization thesis suggests that social media use can bring previously disengaged or under-represented groups into politics. The reinforcement thesis, in contrast, posits that social media has little impact on existing patterns of political participation and can, in fact, exacerbate them. I test these two hypotheses in the context of street protests in Thailand which occurred from November 2013 through March 2014. I contrast data from the Asia Foundation's socioeconomic survey of over 300 street demonstrators with unique socio-demographic profile data drawn from 600 Facebook users affiliated with either the anti-government People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) or the pro-government United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD). I find that overall, political participants on Facebook were of lower socioeconomic status and a younger demographic profile than offline participants for both sides of the political divide. These findings support the mobilization claim by demonstrating that there is less participatory inequality among online participants. The key implications of this study are two-fold. First, data from Thailand permits an examination of socioeconomic stratification of political participation both online and offline in a country outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and with profound digital inequality. Second, the similarities in the socioeconomic backgrounds of the UDD and PDRC online supporters, in stark contrast to their offline counterparts, suggest that social media engagement has a mitigating effect on participatory inequalities. Facebook thus provides a new avenue for those not engaged in offline political activities.},

Evidently this cannot be achieved without considering the political situation of each one of its members and how national policies should be enforced besides consolidating the democratic institutions by stimulating the political participation of citizens and generating the appropriate mechanisms given that democracy leads to prosperity. The objective of this article is to highlight the theoretical elements that are needed for the motivation of citizen's political participation in order to seek a healthy democracy for the development and growth of regional economies. This objective is achieved by analyzing the regulatory frameworks of each of the Pacific Alliance's member-countries and the role of political advertising as a dissemination tool for the construction of democracy.},

  abstract = {Historical evidence shows that Latin America has always suffered from economic and political inequality where the role of commercial unions is fundamental in order to eliminate such barriers. In this sense, the Pacific Alliance has emerged as an agreement to balance the existing differences between its member-countries and to achieve regional economic development. Evidently this cannot be achieved without considering the political situation of each one of its members and how national policies should be enforced besides consolidating the democratic institutions by stimulating the political participation of citizens and generating the appropriate mechanisms given that democracy leads to prosperity. The objective of this article is to highlight the theoretical elements that are needed for the motivation of citizen's political participation in order to seek a healthy democracy for the development and growth of regional economies. This objective is achieved by analyzing the regulatory frameworks of each of the Pacific Alliance's member-countries and the role of political advertising as a dissemination tool for the construction of democracy.},

  abstract = {Policy feedback theory argues that public policies shape mass political behavior by teaching citizens about their relationship to government. I reevaluate this argument by examining how criminal justice policy shapes the political orientations and participation of blacks and whites. I argue that, because these policies send different messages to blacks than to whites about the treatment they can expect from government, these groups have opposite reactions to criminal justice enforcement. Using data from a 2014 national survey and information on local criminal justice outcomes, I find that racially skewed criminal justice enforcement is associated with negative political orientations and lower rates of political participation for highly educated blacks. I also find that whites respond positively to similar criminal justice outcomes when they reside in areas with large black populations. The results show that unequal policy outcomes lead to political inequality.},

Furthermore, empirical indications diverge and give rise to competing theoretical arguments to be tested. This article seeks to fill this gap and to do so by using the latest round of the European Social Survey (ESS). The contribution is twofold: on the one hand, it establishes a direct link between measures of economic and political inequality - albeit of a particular type. On the other, it provides an up-to-date picture on participatory trends in Europe. In more details, income inequality is found to depress overall political participation and, most importantly, to increase the participatory gap between rich and poor for all unconventional forms of engagement.},

  abstract = {Growing economic inequality fosters inequality in the political processes of American democracy. Since the 1970' s inequalities in earnings and wealth have increased dramatically in the United States creating a higher level of inequality in disposable income than in other developed democracies. The United States also lags behind other rich nations in the way it provides for those at the bottom of the income distribution, and there is no evidence that the opportunities for success promised by the American Dream compensate for inequality in America. Technological and economic developments are significant causes of this growing economic inequality. The role of politics is more controversial, but government policy influences the distribution of income and education by the way it determines government benefits, taxes and the way markets function. For a number of reasons-including, most importantly, the relationship between education and income and the ability of the affluent tomake large campaign donations-thosewho are economicallywell-off speakmore loudly in politics. They are more likely to engage in most forms of individual political participation-not only ones that involve using cash but also ones that cost nothing except time. Moreover, when it comes to political voice through organizations, a professionalized domain dominated by hired experts in which the volume of political voice can be altered to reflect available economic resources, affluent interests are more likely to be organized and active. This essay considers the growing economic inequalities that form an important part of the backdrop for unequal political voice.},

Larger legislatures (with respect to population size) promote equality in democratic regimes. The opposite effect is hypothesised for non-democracies, although the empirical results for this group are less significant. I suggest that larger legislatures decrease inequality in democracies by enhancing representative linkages and increasing political participation. On the contrary, they dilute the strength of opposition in authoritarian regimes, leading to inegalitarian outcomes. This study carries strong implications for the understanding of legislatures and the formation of inequality across political systems.},

The substantive findings reveal how the criminal justice system impacts political, economic, and social inequality in the African American community. Due to their considerably diminished capabilities to achieve political and economic equality, one of the recommendations of the study is that streamlining the voting restoration process is necessary for rectifying felony disenfranchised, thereby restoring a fundamental ethos of citizenship to those who have lost their right to vote.},

This article argues that, in their quest to challenge neoliberal policies, labour movements have contributed to processes of democratization in Africa by acting as instruments of political socialization for their members. Using survey data from respondents in 18 African countries, this article demonstrates an empirical relationship between trade union membership and political participation. The article finds that membership in a labour organization increases one's propensity to participate in a range of political activities. Specifically, labour movements encourage participation by forging participatory spillover effects, which mobilize unionists across different arenas of the political landscape. Finally, the article finds that the effect of union membership on political participation is stronger in countries where unions maintain independence from ruling parties. This research contributes to literature on political participation across Africa and furthers our understanding of the role of labour movements in bottom-up processes of democratization on the continent.},

  abstract = {A pivotal question raised in the 1980s debate over the durability of the United States-led world order still haunts us today. Does the postwar liberal international order, which the US was central in shaping, serve US interests? President Trump's answer is a resounding no, promising an ambitious redistributive programme to rebalance global wealth and power. Similar to political platforms in other advanced countries, Trump argues for a fundamental revision of the order, proposing a renewal of international principles to foster a global system tailored to US interests. The major theatres where this battle is being fought are the politics of security, trade and money. Prominent academics align on some aspects of this agenda. Instead, I contend that as the primary beneficiary of the liberal international order, the US will be its first casualty. While President Trump is right to identify the potential role redistribution could play in strengthening America's global leadership, he misidentifies the nature of the distribution problem. Internationally, `America First' is premised on zero-sum logic and poses a risk to the liberal international order, to US security and prosperity. Domestically, `white America First' promises to restore lost greatness to white Americans, aggravating economic and political inequality in the US. Drawing on presidential exit polls, other survey data, real income and income growth nationally and regionally, I explain the 2016 election outcome as a function of education and ethnicity, contextualized by income concerns and racism.

  abstract = {This article analyzes the history of the development of the phenomenon of citizenship in Western Europe, from Antiquity to the Modernity. The analysis uses the binary opposition method, which is the basis for including individuals in or out of citizenship. The citizenship of Ancient Greece was of an elitist nature, sharply distinguishing citizens from the rest of the population. The basis for inclusion / exclusion was the binary oppositions ``civilized - barbarians'', ``free - dependent ``, ``possessing land ownership - not possessing such'', ``adults - minors'', as a result only a small part of the population had the rights of citizens. In the Athenian democracy, for the first time in history, the basic essential characteristics of the concept of ``citizen'' was laid: equality, participation and liberty. The citizenship of Ancient Rome, which received the status of a limited circle of people, during the conquest of new territories included ever wider sections of population. As a result, Roman citizenship was unified, that led to the formation of the legal status of ``subject of the Roman Empire,''for which no longer required property and which did not involve political participation. In the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, for which characteristic subjection and vassalage was a type of relationship between the supreme power and the population, the phenomenon of citizenship existed only in cities. After the revolutions of the Mid Modern Period the achievement of which was the liberation of all categories of the population and the proclamation of equality, the ideas of citizenship began to be embodied within national states. If, at the initial stage, all women and men who did not possess sufficient property were still excluded from political participation, by the end of the Mid Modern Period all men had received a full range of civil rights. During the Modern Period women were granted the right to political participation, therefore, all adult indigenous peoples finally enter into citizenship within national states. Therefore, the list of oppositions began to include only the following: ``native inhabitants of the country - foreigners'' and ``adults - minors''. At the same time, social rights were given special development, which enabled citizens did not worry about their survival and security. Currently, researchers note the following problems in the development of the phenomenon of citizenship: the actual remaining inequality with the declared equality of all citizens, ``citizenship without participation,''when a citizen is a passive consumer of social services provided by the state. The processes of globalization led to mass migration, and it became obvious that the citizenship of the West European country is a huge privilege. The arriving population is again structured within the framework of binary oppositions: ``resident - stranger'', ``an European - a non-European'', ``white - black (black, yellow-skinned)'', `` educated - uneducated'', ``Christian-Muslim'' and so on. The question of inclusion / exclusion in the citizenship of Western European countries today is not fundamentally resolved. The analysis of the phenomenon of citizenship made it possible to draw a conclusion about two cycles of the development of the phenomenon of citizenship. The first cycle - Antiquity, the second cycle - the Medieval Ages and the New Time. For each of them there are some characteristic vectors of development: liberation from dependence (slavish, feudal); Inclusion of ever wider layers of the population in citizenship (the evolution of the phenomenon from elitist to mass); reduction and complete rejection of property requirements for inclusion in citizenship; reduction of active participation of citizens in government; alienation of a citizen from the state, formalization of relations between a citizen and the state. It is possible that the Modern period is the beginning of the third cycle, which will continue its development in accordance with the aforementioned vectors.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of cross-national differences in the relationship between social class location and voting choices has improved substantially in the last decade. Yet scholarship about cross-national and longitudinal variations in the relationship between class location and policy preferences remains neglected. This paper addresses this important gap in the literature through a comparative, longitudinal analysis of the substantial, cross-national variation of class differences in pro-redistribution attitudes. To explain this variation, we focus on the role of preexisting policies and engage with an ongoing debate in the policy feedbacks literature. The self-interest approach argues that higher redistribution creates incentives among the upper classes to oppose redistribution, widening the class cleavage. By contrast, the normative approach argues that universal social policy regimes meet the fairness criteria of middle and upper classes, thereby reducing attitudinal differences. Using an innovative data set containing 106 country-years between 1985 and 2010, our study supports the self-interest approach. Countries achieving more redistribution display larger class cleavages in pro-redistribution attitudes, while universalism does not reduce this divide. The study further shows that redistribution and class cleavage are linearly related because redistribution bolsters the already low commitment with inequality reduction in the upper service and lower service classes.},

Specifically, we examine the effect of between-ethnic-group political and economic inequality on these attachments. Pairing attitudinal data from the sixth and most recent wave of the World Values Survey, administered between 2010 and 2012, with ethnicity measures from the Ethnic Power Relations dataset, we show that between-ethnic-group political inequality significantly weakens national pride and identity, but between-ethnic-group economic inequality does not have a similar effect. Our findings provide robust support for the view that ethnic-group separatism in divided societies is motivated, not by the quest for economic power, but by considerations of lost status and dignity that can only be recovered through ownership in state institutions. Hence, the binding constraint on national integration in these settings is political, not economic, inequality.},

This paper formalizes a theory of polarization where changes in the income distribution do not affect citizens' policy preferences, but instead change their patterns of political participation: aggregate voting decreases relative to aggregate giving, reducing the electoral penalty for partisan policies. By endogenizing party composition the model captures both the ideological and compositional dimensions of polarization, and addresses less-discussed polarization features, such as intra-party homogeneity and the increase in safe seats. According to the model, observed polarization patterns imply that parties have diverged more than candidates, and that the gap between party and candidate divergence has increased with income inequality.},

  abstract = {Centralized sanctioning institutions cultivate cooperation by eradicating the gains from free-riding. Studies show that electing a community member to operate a centralized sanctioning institution further increases support for the public good. These studies have overlooked an all-too-common attribute of non-laboratory elections: political inequality. In this paper, we replicate those studies and, then, introduce novel experimental treatments that examine how political inequality influences the cooperation-enhancing effect of a democratic election to centralized sanctioning institutions. In our novel treatment conditions, participants receive either a random allotment of votes that they can use to elect a centralized sanctioning authority or an allocation of votes proportional to their earnings in a previously-executed public goods game. We find that political inequalities created via the random allocation of votes do not hinder cooperation, whereas political inequalities created via past game play undermine elected authorities and diminish contributions to the public good from individuals advantaged by political inequality.},

  abstract = {Development economists typically apply the same measures of inequality to the Global South as capitalist economies, such as Gini coefficients calculated over cash earnings (income) or asset value (wealth). Yet many rural peoples straddle the market economy of cash and wages and the nonmarket economy of gifts and obligations. We examine inequality in the context of Masikoro farmers, Mikea forager-farmers, and Vezo marine fishers of rural southwestern Madagascar, using quantitative analyses (Gini scores) and qualitative ethnography (village case studies). Gini coefficients indicate greater inequality for cash income rather than total production, for cash income Gini scores confound income inequality with market dependency, and Gini coefficients indicate greater inequality over individuals rather than households, for the latter scale masks gendered inequality. Among farmers and fishers, inequality may occur due to monopolization of the means of production, but only if private property norms replace traditional redistributive and democratizing institutions. Inequality among Mikea foragers results from friction with nonforaging neighbors. Women may experience greater equality relative to men when the foraging ecology favors their subsistence contributions. Inequality varies in degree, form, and experience; economic inequality cannot be divorced from social and political inequality.},

  abstract = {Political participation (POP), social participation (SOP), and political interest (PI) are important indicators of social status and social inequality. Previous studies on related trait differences yielded genetic and environmental contributions. However, focusing on adult samples, classical twin designs, and convenience samples often restricts parameter estimation and generalizability, and limits the understanding of age differences. We investigated sources of variance in POP, SOP, and PI in late adolescence and early adulthood with an extended twin family design (ETFD). We analyzed data from over 2,000 representative German twin families. Individual environments not shared by family members reflected the major source of variance for all variables, but genetic influences were also pronounced. Genetic effects were mostly higher for young adults, whereas effects of twins' shared environment were significant in adolescence. Our study deepens the understanding of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in shaping differences in young persons' integration in society.},

While there is a large literature on the effect of inequality on regime change and support for democracy, there is little research on its effect on political equality across socioeconomic positions. Yet democracy and political equality, although related, are distinct concepts. While political power tends to be more evenly distributed in democracies than in autocracies, there is substantial variation in both regime types. This study argues that economic inequality should decrease political equality through multiple mechanisms: (1) it increases the resources of the rich relative to the poor; (2) it widens the gap in policy preferences across income groups; (3) it reduces participation; and (4) it depresses support for democracy. Using three measures of inequality and data on more than 140 countries between 1961 and 2008, it was found that economic inequality tends to increase political inequality, even when one controls for the level of democracy. Results hold when the sample is restricted by regime type. Finally, evidence in favour of the mechanisms is provided.},

This study argues that economic inequality should decrease political equality through multiple mechanisms: (1) it increases the resources of the rich relative to the poor; (2) it widens the gap in policy preferences across income groups; (3) it reduces participation; and (4) it depresses support for democracy. Using three measures of inequality and data on more than 140 countries between 1961 and 2008, it was found that economic inequality tends to increase political inequality, even when one controls for the level of democracy. Results hold when the sample is restricted by regime type. Finally, evidence in favour of the mechanisms is provided.},

Whereas the effect of economic disparity is well documented in the literature, the implications of the economic downturn have not been sufficiently evaluated so far. The article addresses this gap by offering a comprehensive overview of the impact of these macro-economic factors on individual political participation in Europe. Using data from the first six rounds of the European Social Survey, it shows that income inequality reduces participation and enlarges the participatory gap between better-and worse-off. In contrast, economic contraction has no effect on the overall level of participation and makes the poor participate more and the rich less.},

This article contributes to this debate with two arguments about political involvement: poverty depresses internal political efficacy by undermining cognitive and emotional resources; and dissent in the party system reduces the efficacy gap to higher incomes. Specifically, conflict is to be expected between anti-elite and mainstream parties to simplify political decisions and stimulate political attention among poor voters. These arguments are supported with comparative and experimental analyses. Comparative survey data shows that the income gap in efficacy varies with a novel measure of the anti-elite salience in the party system. The causal impact of anti-elite rhetoric is established though a representative survey experiment. Finally, the article investigates how these mechanisms affect both electoral and other forms of political participation.},

Using a quasi-experimental research design based on a matching technique, the results show that compulsory voting does not have a significant impact on redistributive policies. Examining the experience of Latin America, where mandatory voting prevails along with high income inequality, the article argues that the empirical problem with Lijphart's argument lies in the implicit assumption that there is a programmatic linkage between politicians and voters. An alternative hypothesis is proposed, that the combination of high electoral participation and high inequality may be due to the prevalence of clientelistic linkage, frequent in democracies with weak institutions.},

  abstract = {Participatory budgeting (PB)-a democratic process where ordinary residents decide directly how to spend part of a public budget-has gained impressive momentum in US municipalities, spreading from one pilot project in Chicago's 49th ward in 2009 to 50 active PB processes across 14 cities in 2016-2017. Over 93,600 US residents voted in a PB process in 2015-2016, deciding over a total of about \$49.5 million and funding 264 projects intended to improve their communities. The vast majority of US PB processes take place in large urban centers (e.g., New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Boston), but PB has also recently spread to some smaller cities and towns [1]. Figure 1 illustrates the growth of PB processes in the USA, and within New York City and Chicago council districts specifically. PB constitutes a rare form of public engagement in that it typically comprises several distinct stages that encourage residents to participate from project idea collection to project implementation (see Fig. 2). The decisive public vote in US PB is practically binding as elected officials commit to implementing the public decision at the outset of the process. Moreover, all current PB processes in the USA have expanded voting rights to residents under 18 years old and to non-citizens. Under President Obama, the White House recognized PB as a model for open governance. Participatory Budgeting Project, a nonprofit organization that advocates for PB, won the 2014 Brown Democracy Medal, which recognizes the best work being done to advance democracy in the USA and internationally. PB has been lauded for its potential to energize local democracy, contribute to more equitable public spending and help reduce inequality [2, 3]. Social justice goals have been explicit in US PB from the start. Grassroots advocates, technical assistance providers, and many elected officials who have adopted it emphasize that PB must focus on engaging underrepresented and marginalized communities [2, 4, 5]. PB steering committees have specified equity and inclusiveness goals in PB rule books [6, 7]. The most conclusive research so far on PB's potential to reduce social inequalities, however, comes from Brazil, where PB started in 1989. In Brazil, PB has been associated with a reduction in extreme poverty, better access to public services, greater spending on sanitation and health services, and, most notably, a reduction in child and infant mortality [8, 9]. In this paper, we outline three mechanisms by which PB could affect health disparities in US municipalities: First, by strengthening residents' psychological empowerment; second, by strengthening civic sector alliances; and third, by (re) distributing resources to areas of greatest need. We summarize the theoretical argument for these impacts, discuss the existent empirical evidence, and highlight promising avenues for further research.},

  abstract = {I demonstrate that a set of well-known objections defeat John Stuart Mill's plural voting proposal, but do not defeat plural voting as such. I adopt the following as a working definition of political equality: a voting system is egalitarian if and only if departures from a baseline of equally weighted votes are normatively permissible. I develop an alternative proposal, called procedural plural voting, which allocates plural votes procedurally, via the free choices of the electorate, rather than according to a substantive standard of competence. The alternative avoids standards objections to Mill's proposal. Moreover, reflection on the alternative plural voting scheme disrupts our intuitions about what counts as an egalitarian voting system. Undue emphasis on Mill's version of plural voting obscures three important reasons to reject plural voting in favor of strictly egalitarian voting systems: (1) that certain choices that generate inequalities of political power are morally impermissible; (2) that even chosen inequalities may undermine the potential epistemic benefits of democratic decision-making; and (3) that such choices may undermine citizens' commitments to democracy understood as a joint project.},

  abstract = {During the Jim Crow era of 1877 to 1954, the federal government sponsored and supported the racially separate and unequal distribution of resources, including, but not limited to, education, housing, employment, and healthcare. On May 14, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that separate and unequal education violated the Constitution because separate is inherently unequal. Many believed that this ruling, the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 would put an end to the unequal treatment of African Americans in the United States. However, inequalities still exist today because the ruling and the laws did not change the structures of the United States. Specifically, structural racism prevents African Americans from obtaining equal access to resources such as wealth, employment, income, and healthcare, resulting in racial disparities in health. Because racial disparities between African Americans and Caucasians are the most studied in the United States, this article will focus exclusively on how structural racism continues and causes racial inequalities between African Americans and Caucasians in wealth, employment, income, and healthcare, which lead to racial disparities in access to healthcare and health status.},

  abstract = {The United States has reached a point of economic inequality that has not been seen since the 1920s. According to the median voter theorem of redistribution, democracy is supposed to act as a check on growing economic inequality. The intuition behind this theorem is simple: If a majority of the population sees their incomes stagnate while a wealthy minority gets richer, the majority will demand redistributive policies, and representatives will respond by addressing inequality. But in the United States, very little redistribution has accompanied rising economic inequality. Why has democracy failed to check economic inequality in the United States? Political scientists and legal scholars have pointed to political inequality as the culprit. Political scientists have shown that elected representatives are much more responsive to the wealthy than any other income group. Legal scholars have argued in favor of equalizing campaign finance and regulating lobbying as ways to reduce political inequality. Empirical studies, however, have raised doubts about the effectiveness of any reform efforts aimed at those areas, and constitutional law disfavors solutions aimed at diminishing the political voice of the wealthy. In this Article, I argue that reducing the income class imbalance of the electorate-i.e. the tendency of wealthier voters to vote at higher rates than less affluent ones-will be a more constitutionally viable and effective means of ameliorating political inequality. I base this argument on the median voter theorem, which suggests that elected officials decide whether or not to adopt redistributive policies based on whether they believe the median voter desires such policies. Because the poor vote less and have less access to their elected representatives, representatives perceive the electorate to be better off than the population as a whole actually is, diminishing the pressure to redistribute in contexts of rising economic inequality. The ideal solution to this form of political inequality is to induce the participation of the poor and enhance their engagement with elected officials through campaign mobilization. Mobilizing the poor would not only increase the proportion of the poor in the electorate, but more importantly, would change how representatives perceive the electorate and its demands for redistribution. Achieving these goals will require looking to new legal strategies aimed at incentivizing mobilization. I examine three legal strategies that could increase the incentives for political cam-paigns to mobilize the poor: campaign finance vouchers, earmarking campaign contributions, and a mobilization-matching fund. I conclude by suggesting a path to advancing these strategies in the current political climate.},

This article also considers that the effect of macroeconomic conditions on repertoires of participation might depend on citizens' socioeconomic resources - such as education, employment status, and income - with consequences for participation gaps or inequalities. Using multilevel models and data from seven rounds of the European Social Survey, this article shows that in contexts where macroeconomic conditions are worse, the probability of engaging in the protest repertoire increases, while the probability of engaging in the other three repertoires does not depend on the economy.

This article argues that in hierarchical societies with high social-status inequality, cross-class coalitions can emerge among high-status voters if they believe their social status is under threat. I demonstrate this in the context of the Indian states by exploiting an announcement by the Government of India in 1990 to implement affirmative action for lower castes-an intervention that threatened to weaken the social status of upper caste Brahmans. Using unique data from the 1931 census, this article shows that areas where Brahmans were more dominant in the 1930s experienced a higher surge in right-wing voting after this announcement than other areas. Using survey data, I find that both wealthy and poor Brahmans voted for the right wing where Brahmans were dominant in 1931. The article shows how concerns about social status may make the poor open to appeals by antiredistribution parties.},

  abstract = {Why do some ethnic groups vote along ethnic lines while others do not? In this article, we theorize that the level of ethnic voting depends, partially, on how ethnicity interacts with economic cleavages. Specifically, we argue that between-ethnic group inequality (BGI) increases ethnic voting and that its effect strengthens as within-ethnic group inequality (WGI) decreases. We thus posit that the full structure of ethnic inequality, not only between-group differences, matters for ethnic voting. After presenting our argument, we conduct the first cross-national test of whether the effect of between-group inequality on ethnic voting is conditional on the level of inequality within ethnic groups. Our analysis employs group-level data on 200 ethnic groups from 65 countries. We find strong support for our hypothesis: BGI increases ethnic voting, but its effect is conditional on WGI.},

  abstract = {While recent political transformation has brought several inclusion policies and changes in Nepal, Dalit are still politically excluded. In order to trace out the political inequality of Dalit and to generalize the findings, both primary and secondary qualitative data have been interpreted and analyzed. The key informant interview method was employed to explore the experiences of Dalit on the current political inequality, identity debates, and representation. It was found that deeply rooted caste hierarchy and discrimination practices are underlying detrimental factors for the depleted socio-economic, educational, and political status of Dalit in Nepal. The conception of Dalit as a common identity, although contested among Dalit, is only a short-term strategy to unite them against all forms of injustice including caste based discrimination, and to achieve equality. It can be concluded that special political representation measures, such as proportional representation (PR), are one of the major institutional reforms for achieving social justice for Dalit in Nepal.},

This article critically reviews the main findings of the emerging literature on insider-outsider divides to highlight its possible contributions to adjacent fields, in particular the research on party politics, the literatures on economic voting, political participation, and democratic representation or the study of social movements. The conflict between labor market insiders and outsiders demonstrates that in today's societies with their diversified risk structure and sophisticated welfare states, distributive conflicts are about specific social and regulatory policies that have different implications for individuals depending on their situation on the labor market. By drawing our attention to new divides within the social democratic electorate, the insider-outsider literature reveals an additional argument why the social democratic parties find it hard to mobilize their voters and to win elections. Moreover, the insider-outsider literature can help to bring the economic dimension of politics back to the study of social movements and to light on the relationship between contentious and conventional politics.},

We argue that populist attitudes can be a motivation for participation through their identity, emotional, and moral components, and that they have the potential to narrow socioeconomic gaps in participation. Using survey data from nine European countries, our results show that populist attitudes are positively related to expressive non-institutionalized modes of participation (petition signing, online participation and, in some contexts, demonstrating), but not to turnout. In addition, populist attitudes are found to reduce education-based gaps and even reverse income-based inequalities in political participation. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

However, this article argues that this does not automatically translate into a less biased political voice because compulsory voting also generates socioeconomically biased invalid votes, which is demonstrated on the case of Ecuador. Normatively, we deny the existence of a general moral and legal duty to vote, which would justify compelling a citizen to vote. Achieving higher levels of social equality does not automatically take priority over a citizen's rights to liberty and conscience. Furthermore, we object in general to the paternalistic justification of compulsory voting made by its defenders. Thus, we find that instituting compulsory voting as an instrument of reducing class inequalities is unwarranted both empirically and normatively.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Sex differences in adolescent health are widely documented, but social explanations for these sex differences are scarce. This study examines whether societal gender inequality (i.e., men's and women's unequal share in political participation, decision-making power, economic participation, and command over resources) relates to sex differences in adolescent physical fighting, physical activity, and injuries. Methods: National-level data on gender inequality (i.e., the United Nations Development Program's Gender Inequality Index) were linked to health data from 71,255 15-year-olds from 36 countries in the 2009-2010 Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children study. Using multilevel logistic regression analyses, we tested the association between gender inequality and sex differences in health while controlling for country wealth (gross domestic product per capita). Results: In all countries, boys reported more physical fighting, physical activity, and injuries than girls, but the magnitude of these sex differences varied greatly between countries. Societal gender inequality positively related to sex differences in all three outcomes. In more gender unequal countries, boys reported higher levels of fighting and physical activity compared with boys in more gender equal countries. In girls, scores were consistently low for these outcomes; however, injury was more common in countries with less gender inequality. Conclusions: Societal gender inequality appears to relate to sex differences in some adolescent health behaviors and may contribute to the establishment of sex differences in morbidity and mortality. To reduce inequalities in the health of future generations, public health policy should target social and cultural factors that shape perceived gender norms in young people.

MethodsWe use Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RSEI (Risk-Screening Environmental Indicator) database to create measures of exposure to industrial air toxins and inequality in exposure by race and poverty status. Measures were calculated for each of three periods: 1990-1994, 2000-2004, and 2010-2014. ResultsExposure declined but inequality persisted. The geographic patterns displayed by race- and poverty-related environmental inequality differ. But, states with higher levels of race-based inequality had higher levels of exposure. Poverty-based environmental and economic inequality exhibited a moderate, positive relation that was spatially patterned. ConclusionWhile environmental quality improved, we saw little progress in reducing environmental inequality. Though both race- and poverty-based inequality remain, they result from different mechanisms. Future research should examine the relations between deindustrialization and economic, environmental, and political inequality.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveTo examine state-level environmental inequality trends over time by constructing a new, longitudinal data set and comparing change in environmental and economic inequality. MethodsWe use Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RSEI (Risk-Screening Environmental Indicator) database to create measures of exposure to industrial air toxins and inequality in exposure by race and poverty status. Measures were calculated for each of three periods: 1990-1994, 2000-2004, and 2010-2014. ResultsExposure declined but inequality persisted. The geographic patterns displayed by race- and poverty-related environmental inequality differ. But, states with higher levels of race-based inequality had higher levels of exposure. Poverty-based environmental and economic inequality exhibited a moderate, positive relation that was spatially patterned. ConclusionWhile environmental quality improved, we saw little progress in reducing environmental inequality. Though both race- and poverty-based inequality remain, they result from different mechanisms. Future research should examine the relations between deindustrialization and economic, environmental, and political inequality.},

Previous research has found that higher inequality makes people of all incomes less likely to participate in politics, consistent with relative power theory, which holds that greater inequality enables wealthier citizens to more fully reshape the political landscape to their own advantage. Campaign activities, however, demand more time and money than previously examined forms of participation and so might better conform to the predictions of resource theory, which focuses narrowly on the ramifications of inequality for individuals' resources. MethodsWe combine individual-level data on donations, meeting attendance, and volunteer work for political campaigns with measures of state-level income inequality to construct a series of multilevel models. ResultsThe analyses reveal that, where inequality is higher, campaign participation is lower among individuals of all incomes. ConclusionsPatterns of participation in even resource-intensive campaign activities provide support for the relative power theory.},

(2) Does Internet news use amplify or reduce participation gaps that exist among individuals at various socioeconomic strata? (3) How does a country's press freedom act as a contextual factor to shape the role of the Internet in affecting protest participation gaps? The results based on an analysis of the third wave of Arab Democracy Barometer survey suggest that Internet news use for political purposes increases the likelihood of protest participation in the Arab world while it also deepens socioeconomic stratification in participation. Furthermore, national press freedom shapes the intervening role of the Internet. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for political inequality literature and the practical consequences for the Arab world.},

There is a significant number of works in the literature today that examine each of the chains of this relationship separately (the influence of social position on political preferences, the impact of political preferences on political participation). However, the role of political preference as a mediator of the influence of social position on political participation has not been studied. The current work contributes to the development of this approach by applying a model of mediation effect. The model consists of three variables: dependent (political participation), independent (social position), and mediator variable (political preferences). In order to construct the corresponding regressions and assess significances, the authors constructed a three-dimensional space of political preferences: the first axis is associated with the ideas of the agreement about material inequality, the second axis is the ideas about the importance of a welfare state, and the third axis is the degree of tolerance for migrants. Two types of political participation were considered with respect to the dependent variable: voting and direct participation initiated by citizens rather than by government. The study examined data from the 8th wave of the European Social Survey (2016), and the analysis was carried out on three groups of countries: Western Europe (Belgium, Austria, Germany, France), post-socialist countries of Central Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland), and Russia. The results reveal the statistical significance of political preferences as a mediator of the influence of social position on political participation; meanwhile, the direction of influence was nearly the same for the three groups of countries. The differences between the states were in the (non-)significance of the coefficients themselves. As a whole, it may be concluded that in relation to Western countries, the obtained patterns correspond quite accurately to the present views in the literature; the impact of social position on political participation in post-socialist countries (including Russia) is less significant, as only a few social differences are manifested in the political sphere.},

However, the relationship between intergroup inequality and ethnic bloc voting behavior has escaped empirical analysis. We test the relationship between ethnic bloc voting and horizontal inequality by examining how relative disparity affects individuals' probability of supporting the same political party as other co-ethnics. MethodsThis project uses data from the Integrated World and European Values Survey to test the relationship between relative disparity and ethnic bloc support in ethnically polarized states from 1981 to 2006. ResultsOur findings indicate that the probability of supporting the same party as other co-ethnics is influenced by within-group as well as between-group inequality, while being relatively unaffected by individual-level income. ConclusionWe conclude that increasing horizontal inequality, and not individual resources, leads to higher rates of ethnically polarized voting, which may lead to greater levels of ethnic conflict.},

  abstract = {Previous research has argued that political inequality between ethnic groups increases the likelihood of both nonviolent and violent protest. In this study, I focus on civil resistance campaigns and argue that the probability that these large-scale, organized movements will take violent over nonviolent forms increases with the share of a country's population that is excluded from political power on the basis of ethnic affiliation. I expect this to be so because ethnically exclusive regimes are more likely to counter political demands with violent repression, which increases the cost and decreases the anticipated success of nonviolent relative to violent resistance. I test this proposition in a global sample of countries for the period 1950-2006 and find, first, that high levels of ethnic exclusion make civil resistance campaigns more likely to occur violently than nonviolently. Next, to assess the mechanism at play, I conduct a mediation analysis and show that almost half of the effect of ethnic exclusion on violent campaign onset is mediated by the latent level of violent repression in a country. This result suggests that political authorities' repressive strategies are key to explaining why regime opponents do not always opt for nonviolent forms of civil resistance.},

They identify the deliberate destruction of democratic norms as the key cause of erosion and thus triggered avigorous debate within political science that is recounted here. Moreover, this literature report adds arguments that the US moves towards an oligarchy as well as policy analysis research demonstrating how asymmetrical balance of power relations within the American society undermine the democratic system. Social inequality and injustice are viewed as consequences of asymmetrical opportunities of political participation. Acting strategically certain elites pursue their interests uninhibitedly and ultimately at the expense of democratic principles. Distinct research programs on norm erosion on the one hand and on social and participatory inequalities on the other demonstrate that the comparative democracy analysis is based on two contending social theories: According to rationalism actors pursue invariant preferences. Democracy emerges when actors conflict and are forced to aggregate their interests. According to constructivism preferences of actors can be transformed. The consequence of the pursuit of conflicts is less the assertion of interest as finding compromise solutions above and beyond aggregation and the emergence of shared norms of democratic appropriateness as well as asocial (or democratic) community. Further research on democracy will have to show whether consolidated democracies die as aresult of dysfunctional pursuit of preferences or the erosion of norms and social communities.},

Design/methodology/approach The paper analyzes the Korean General Social Survey 2009 and 2014 and estimates logit and OLS models. Findings The authors find that neither the perceived inequality of income distribution nor the perceived inequality of opportunities affects the likelihood of individuals' vote participation. The authors, however, find that the perceptions of inequality, both in terms of outcomes and opportunities affect citizens' engagement in non-institutional forms of political participation. Originality/value This study provides a new discussion point about the political consequences of inequality in Korea. This paper distinguishes and analyzes the relative importance of perceived inequality of the outcomes and opportunities in democratic engagements. By considering various types of participation, institutional and non-institutional, this study contributes to deepen our understanding of the factors that drive citizens' democratic political engagements.},

  abstract = {How do economic grievances affect citizens' inclination to protest? Given rising levels of inequality and widespread economic hardship in the aftermath of the Great Recession, this question is crucial for political science: if adverse economic conditions depress citizens' engagement, as many contributions have argued, then the economic crisis may well feed into a crisis of democracy. However, the existing research on the link between economic grievances and political participation remains empirically inconclusive. It is argued in this article that this is due to two distinct shortcomings, which are effectively addressed by combining the strengths of political economy and social movement theories. Based on ESS and EU-SILC data from 2006-2012, as well as newly collected data on political protest in 28 European countries, a novel, more fine-grained conceptualisation of objective economic grievances considerably improves our understanding of the direct link between economic grievances and protest behaviour. While structural economic disadvantage (i.e., the level of grievances) unambiguously de-mobilises individuals, the deterioration of economic prospects (i.e., a change in grievances) instead increases political activity. Revealing these two countervailing effects provides an important clarification that helps reconcile many seemingly conflicting findings in the existing literature. Second, the article shows that the level of political mobilisation substantially moderates this direct link between individual hardship and political activity. In a strongly mobilised environment, even structural economic disadvantage is no longer an impediment to political participation. There is a strong political message in this interacting factor: if the presence of organised and visible political action is a decisive signal for citizens that conditions the micro-level link between economic grievances and protest, then democracy itself - that is, organised collective action - can help sustain political equality and prevent the vicious circle of democratic erosion.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that people with disabilities are the most marginalised and vulnerable group within any population. However, little is known about the extent of inequality between people with and without disabilities in contexts where the majority of persons experience extreme poverty and hardship. This includes in Liberia, where very little is understood about the lives of disabled people in general. This study uses a multidimensional wellbeing framework to understand perceived relative inequality associated with disability by assessing several facets of wellbeing across and within households containing disabled members (N = 485) or households with no disabled members (N = 538) in Liberian communities (Total individuals surveyed, N = 2020). Statistical comparisons (adjusted for age, sex, education and wealth differences and clustered at the household, village and county level) reveal that disabled Liberians are managing similarly to non-disabled Liberians in terms of income and education, but experience many perceived relative inequalities including in life satisfaction, transport access, political participation and social inclusion. Our results further suggest that disability may lead to perceived relative inequality at the household level in terms of trust held in neighbours. However, they also show that being the head of a household may protect against perceived relative inequality in certain dimensions (e.g. healthcare and transport access, political participation) irrespective of disability status. Results are discussed in terms of practical implications for development efforts in Liberia and for disabled people in other low- and middle-income settings.},

Yet the mechanisms through which these legacies get transmitted over time remain ambiguous. This article analyzes the choice and effects of legislative representation as one such mechanism, driven by elites interested in maximizing jointly economic prospects and political influence over time. We focus on malapportionment in the legislatures of the original 13 British North-American colonies. Their joint independence created a unique juncture in which postcolonial elites simultaneously chose the legislative and electoral institutions under which they would operate. We show that the initial choice of apportionment in the state legislatures is largely a function of economic geography, that such a choice generated persistent differences in representation patterns within states (political inequality), and that the latter shaped public goods provision in the long run.},

Furthermore, social media use, like radio and television use, exacerbates education-generated inequality. Press freedom as a socio-political factor reinforces the role of the television, print newspaper, and social media in participation inequality. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.},

This paper argues that, at the roots of current gender inequalities, there are traditional patriarchal social structures in which power is unequally distributed, with men traditionally holding authority over women. The power imbalance is manifested in governance arrangements, of which we consider discriminatory formal laws and informal normative systems that perpetuate gender inequality. We review the evidence on the effectiveness of reforms addressing gender inequality and applied via formal law changes. Given the possibility of endogeneity issues as reforms may have been adopted in countries where attitudes toward women had already been improving, we focus on micro-empirical studies that tackle this challenge. The evidence suggests that some reforms have been successful in reducing inequalities. Power and norms can shift and sometimes temporary interventions can deliver long-term results.},

We construct measures of political inequality and political patronage using voting data, and economic inequality measures using representative household data. Firstly, we find a strong concave relationship between economic inequality and access to residential supply of natural gas. Secondly, we find that the presence of strong-men who can capture large vote shares is associated with higher access to natural gas. We uncover an optimal size of patrons: Patrons have an insignificant positive effect on access when patrons capture less than 20\% of the votes and an insignificant negative effect when they capture more than 30\%. At 20\%, they have a positive effect that is significant in both a statistical and an economic sense.},

Stratification beliefs research has traditionally focused on describing what is believed about inequality, demonstrating the antecedents of beliefs, and outlining the consequences of belief adherence for the person, politics, and society. Race and ethnicity matter for Americans' beliefs about poverty in a number of important ways. Research documents that the poor are themselves racialized in the public mind. The racial composition of people's communities has demonstrable effects on how people think about the poor. And race/ethnic group membership is one of the most potent individual-level determinants of beliefs about poverty. Research also documents important consequences of such stratification beliefs, including their impact on people's voting behavior and support for social policies designed to ameliorate racial and other inequalities. The author concludes with suggestions for future research in hopes of advancing our understanding of links between race/ethnicity, stratification ideology, and relevant attitudinal and behavioral outcomes.},

In Australia, policy initiatives have addressed concerns about the low levels of political knowledge among young people. Yet research about how young Australians acquire political knowledge, beyond schools, is scarce. The present study referring to the concepts of situated learning, self-determination and knowledge gap, asks whether young adult's participatory practices (e.g., participation in politics, prior involvement in decision-making at school) predict political knowledge. Analyses that control for multiple predictors of political knowledge suggest differential associations between political knowledge and different participatory practices. Motivational inequality, as defined by interest in politics, moderates the associations with party-political participation and participation at school; the conditional effect of party-related political participation is further moderated by educational resources. Gendered differences are identified for some participatory practices. Directions for future research and the importance of participatory experiences and how to establish a foundation of young citizens' political knowledge are discussed.},

Methodology is comparative and content analysed. The findings show that gender inequality in political participation is a global phenomenon. Gender mainstreaming in some states that have declared Islam as the state religion is far ahead of some advanced democracies. Barriers to women's political participation vary from socioeconomic to institutional. This paper stresses the role of women as political equals of men, yet their primary role as mothers, wives and daughters cannot be undermined.},

Merging individual-level survey data from the 2016 Gallup World Poll with country-level indices, we conduct multilevel analyses to answer three broader sets of questions: (1) Does access to the Internet increase the likelihood of civic participation? (2) Does Internet access amplify or lessen socioeconomic stratification in civic participation? (3) Do press freedom and government intervention as contextual factors shape the role of the Internet in civic participation inequality? The findings suggest that Internet access increases the likelihood of civic participation while it also deepens socioeconomic stratification in participation. Cross-level interactions unveil that the intervening role of the Internet remains unaffected by press freedom, but government intervention through the promotion of ICT use can help control the growing inequality. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for political inequality research and the applied global significance.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Latinx and Black young adults' experiences with the U.S. political system have been contentious. Despite this, they utilize psychological strengths, such as their critical consciousness (CC), to participate in the political process. This research explored relations between CC (e.g., critical reflection of social inequality and voting likelihood) and forms of civic/political engagement (e.g., sociopolitical action and social media engagement) among Latinx and Black young adults. Method: Measurement invariance (MI) tests and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used with Latinx (N = 354, M-age = 26.08, SD = 5.03) young adults who were slightly predominately male (55.1\%) and Black American young adults (N = 160, M-age = 25.84, SD = 4.98) who were slightly predominately female (52.5\%). Results: MI results indicated measures were not invariant (i.e., they were measured differently) across groups. Therefore, the hypothesized model was examined separately for groups. SEM analyses suggested both groups' critical reflection positively predicted voting likelihood and sociopolitical action. For Latinx young adults, voting likelihood mediated the relation between critical reflection and social media engagement. Black young adults' voting likelihood was unrelated to sociopolitical action and social media engagement. Alternative models examined bidirectional relations between CC and civic/political engagement. Conclusions: Findings suggest civic/political engagement pathways differ for Latinx and Black young adults. However, fostering critical reflection has the potential to stimulate both groups' intent to vote and sociopolitical action.},

Are richer voters more strategic than poorer voters? Does strategic behavior vary with age, education, gender, or political leaning? The answers may be important for assessing how well an electoral system represents different preferences in society. We introduce a new approach to measuring and comparing strategic voting across voters that can be broadly applied, given appropriate survey data. In recent British elections, we find that older voters vote more strategically than younger voters and that richer voters vote more strategically than poorer voters, even as strategic behavior varies little across the education level. The differences in strategic voting by age and income are smaller than observed differences in turnout by age and income, but they tend to exacerbate these better-known inequalities in political participation.},

  abstract = {During the last three decades, a notable increase in economic inequality is observed, accompanied by a decline in people's engagement in politics and electoral participation. This is an unsatisfactory phenomenon as it undermines the legitimacy of democratic representation. This negative association is produced by a complex salient mechanism. This study aims at investigating this issue. Using data from a panel of 28 OECD and European countries, this paper identifies a two-way causal relationship between inequality and political participation.

  abstract = {During the last three decades, a notable increase in economic inequality is observed, accompanied by a decline in people's engagement in politics and electoral participation. This is an unsatisfactory phenomenon as it undermines the legitimacy of democratic representation. This negative association is produced by a complex salient mechanism. This study aims at investigating this issue. Using data from a panel of 28 OECD and European countries, this paper identifies a two-way causal relationship between inequality and political participation. The results show that greater income inequality alienates and discourages people from engaging with common affairs, thus leading to lower political participation. Yet, lower electoral participation leads towards a less equitable distribution of income. Hence, this study reveals a self-reinforcing mechanism where the unequal distribution of income leads to political exclusion, which in turn leads to more inequality.},

  abstract = {This article analyses whether and how the persistent positive relationship between socioeconomic status and political participation can be moderated by institutional design. Hopes to boost turnout rates of socially disadvantaged citizens often rest upon the introduction of participatory institutions. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Alexis de Tocqueville and John Stuart Mill had already asserted claims about the educative effect of close political institutions at the local level, which presumably result in a decrease in social inequality. More recently, campaigns for greater regional authority throughout Europe have represented a demand for opportunities to participate in decentralised, accessible polities. Based on data from 259 regions in Europe, we investigate whether political decentralisation and increased opportunities to participate are appropriate means of mitigating political inequality. The results not only fail to meet expectations but show that decentralisation in fact reinforces unequal voter turnout. These findings are particularly relevant for combatting inequality and indicating the potential side effects of decentralisation campaigns.},

This finding is one of the most frequently confirmed results in empirical research on political participation and questions the principle of political equality. This so called social selectivity has been proven above all for elections but also in unconventional forms of participation such as collections of signatures or protests. In this paper we ask about social selectivity in local referenda and compare it with social selectivity in local council elections in Germany. The analyses are based on data for 56 referenda and 56 local council elections that took place in German cities (\textquestiondown 100,000 inhabitants) between 2000 and 2017. First, we show that social selectivity is also a problem of direct democracy. Secondly, the comparison between referenda and elections shows that in most cases the selectivity problem in direct-democratic voting is lower than in elections. We thus refute the frequently expressed assumption that the inequality problem is greater in referenda than in representative elections. Theoretically, we justify these findings with assumptions based on the theory of rational voter behavior. We also show for referenda that there is no linear negative correlation between the level of voter turnout and the degree of social selectivity that is often expected.},

  abstract = {Gender differences in voting patterns and political attitudes towards redistribution are well-documented. The experimental gender literature suggests several plausible behavioral explanations behind these differences, relating to gender differences in confidence concerning future relative income position, risk aversion, and social preferences. We use data from lab experiments on preferences for redistribution conducted in the U.S. and several European countries to investigate gender differences and their causes. On aggregate, women's demand for redistribution is higher than men's, but the differences vary considerably across locations and countries. Moreover, the gender difference appears only when the source of inequality is based on relative abilities, but not when it is based on luck. Our most robust finding is that across all sampled locations, men' s relatively higher (over)confidence in their abilities, in comparison to women, leads them to specify lower redistribution levels. We discuss the role of confidence in accounting for gender differences in political and redistributive choices outside the lab. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Background While in general a country's life expectancy increases with national income, some countries ``punch above their weight'', while some ``punch below their weight'' - achieving higher or lower life expectancy than would be predicted by their per capita income. Discovering which conditions or policies contribute to this outcome is critical to improving population health globally. Methods We conducted a mixed-method study which included: analysis of life expectancy relative to income for all countries; an expert opinion study; and scoping reviews of literature and data to examine factors that may impact on life expectancy relative to income in three countries: Ethiopia, Brazil, and the United States. Punching above or below weight status was calculated using life expectancy at birth and gross domestic product per capita for 2014-2018. The scoping reviews covered the political context and history, social determinants of health, civil society, and political participation in each country. Results Possible drivers identified for Ethiopia's extra 3 years life expectancy included community-based health strategies, improving access to safe water, female education and gender empowerment, and the rise of civil society organisations. Brazil punched above its weight by 2 years. Possible drivers identified included socio-political and economic improvements, reduced inequality, female education, health care coverage, civil society, and political participation. The United States' neoliberal economics and limited social security, market-based healthcare, limited public health regulation, weak social safety net, significant increases in income inequality and lower levels of political participation may have contributed to the country punching 2.9 years below weight. Conclusions The review highlighted potential structural determinants driving differential performance in population health outcomes cross-nationally. These included greater equity, a more inclusive welfare system, high political participation, strong civil society and access to employment, housing, safe water, a clean environment, and education. We recommend research comparing more countries, and also to examine the processes driving within-country inequities.},

  abstract = {The cultural dimension of power distance refers to individuals' acceptance of power inequalities in society. Countries characterized by high power distance at the collective level face more domestic extremism. However, research has yet to examine how individual differences in power distance orientation may affect individuals' intentions to engage in radical and violent political action. In this research, we test the hypothesis that stronger endorsement of power distance values makes people more prone to express their intentions to engage in radical and violent political action. To test the hypothesis' generalizability across contexts, we sample from 2 countries characterized by different levels of power distance at the collective level, South Korea (higher power distance) and the United States (lower power distance). Studies 1a and 1b were surveys (N = 1,214) demonstrating an association between power distance orientation and radical political action over and beyond other known predictors of political participation, including political efficacy, perceived justice, emotions of anger and contempt, political orientation, and social dominance orientation. In Studies 2a-2c (N = 430; 2c preregistered), priming a higher (vs. lower) power distance orientation heightened individuals' propensity to express the intentions to engage in radical political action. Theoretical implications of the findings, and future research directions, are discussed.},

But the social and historical inequalities suffered by women hinder their participation in the democratic game, with implies political inequalities that limit their possibilities of exercising citizenship in democratic contexts, a diagnosis that is deduced after the analysis of statistical data on political participation in Spain that it's shown.},

Using large-scale cross-national survey data, we show that (1) strong income bias in turnout exists in many parts of the world, (2) higher income inequality is related to lower income bias in turnout by demobilizing high-income citizens and mobilizing lowincome citizens, and (3) this relationship is partly explained by the pattern that vote buying is more common in societies with higher income inequality and thus mobilizes low-income citizens but decreases political efficacy among high-income citizens. Ultimately, this study suggests that growing income inequality may not exaggerate political inequality, but may challenge the legitimacy of democratic elections.},

However, there has been a lack of empirical evidence about this relationship, particularly, in cross-national comparative research. This is largely because cross-national measures of political inequality are underdeveloped. To fill this gap, this study introduces a new way of conceptualizing and measuring political inequality and construct; the Political Inequality Index (PII), which is mainly based on objective indicators. Additionally, the Political Power Inequality Index (PPII) based on subjective indicators is presented as an alternative measure. This research then explores the features of these measures and investigates the impact of economic inequality on political inequality with the measures. The dynamic panel data analysis controlling for endogeneity provides little evidence that income inequality has a significant effect on political inequality, however.},

Despite the high human, economic and political toll associated with terrorism, the effect of a country's arms trade on the propensity to experience terrorist attacks has received scant attention so far. We argue that arms imports affect a country's institutional landscape, increasing grievances due to corruption, exclusion and human rights violations; these grievances, in turn, incite terrorism. We leverage plausibly exogenous variation in global arms trade patterns as an instrument to provide causal evidence of a significant positive effect of arms imports on terrorist activity for 179 countries between 1992 and 2018. We also show that arms imports indeed increase corruption and political exclusion, which may explain why arms imports ultimately encourage terrorist activity. Finally, the adverse effect of arms imports on terrorism is strongest among countries characterized by low levels of fiscal capacity and high levels of political inequality and authoritarianism.},

While many electoral reforms promise to increase political participation, these policy instruments may have multidimensional and differential effects that can increase or decrease the representativeness of turnout. We develop an approach that allows us to estimate these effects and assess the impact of postal voting on representational inequality in Swiss referendums using individual-level (N = 79, 000) and aggregate-level data from 1981 to 2009. We find that postal voting mobilizes equally across a wide range of political and sociodemographic groups but more strongly activates high earners, those with medium education levels, and less politically interested individuals. Yet, those who vote are not less politically knowledgeable and the effects on the composition of turnout remain limited. Our results inform research on the consequences of electoral reforms meant to increase political participation in large electorates.},

Other research indicates that salient political events can push individuals to participate. I offer a novel explanation of how mundane household experiences translate to political engagement, even in settings where low participation levels are typically found, such as immigrant communities. I hypothesize that experiences requiring children of Latinx immigrants to take on ``adult'' responsibilities provide an environment where children learn the skills needed to overcome the costs associated with participation. I test this hypothesis using three datasets: a survey of Latinx students, a representative survey of young adults, and a 10-year longitudinal study. The analyses demonstrate that Latinx children of immigrants taking on adult responsibilities exhibit higher levels of political activity compared with those who do not. These findings provide new insights into how the cycle of generational political inequality is overcome in unexpected ways and places.},

  abstract = {College is a key pathway to political participation, and lower-income individuals especially stand to benefit from it given their lower political participation. However, rising inequality makes college disproportionately more accessible to high-income students. One consequence of inequality is a prevalence of predominantly affluent campuses. Colleges are thus not insulated from the growing concentration of affluence in American social spaces. We ask how affluent campus spaces affect college's ability to equalize political participation. Predominantly affluent campuses may create participatory norms that especially elevate low-income students' participation. Alternatively, they may create affluence-centered social norms that marginalize these students, depressing their participation. A third possibility is equal effects, leaving the initial gap unchanged. Using a large panel survey (201,011 students), controls on many characteristics, and tests for selection bias, we find that predominantly affluent campuses increase political participation to a similar extent for all income groups, thus leaving the gap unchanged. We test psychological, academic, social, political, financial, and institutional mechanisms for the effects. The results carry implications for the self-reinforcing link between inequality and civic institutions.},

  abstract = {Economic voting is multidimensional (covering valence, patrimony and positional dimensions), and a growing number of research contributions have explored the existence and strength of the effect of these dimensions on voting. However, we know comparatively little about the interplay between these dimensions. This article fills that void by focusing on how the interplay between the rise of income inequality (the valence dimension) and redistribution preferences (the positional dimension) influences support for incumbents. Using the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) Modules 4 and 5, I find that preferences for income redistribution reduce the likelihood of voters supporting incumbent parties. Modest evidence demonstrates that this relationship is stronger in countries where inequality increased to a greater degree between elections. Voters who want more redistribution tend to re-elect left-wing governments and want to throw out right-wing incumbents. However, rise of inequality hurts both left-wing and right-wing incumbents.},

  abstract = {The New Development Bank (NDB) and the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) were built by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (the BRICS countries) in response to the `disappointing' Bretton Woods Institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The main difference between the Bretton Woods Institutions and the BRICS institutions is that the latter adopts an equal-weight system instead of a weighted voting system in the NDB (all five BRICS countries have equal shares and voting weights regardless of the major differences in their economic weights) and uses consensus instead of majority voting rules to make decisions regarding critical issues in the CRA. In fact, both the equal-weight system and consensus rule are unprecedented in the history of multilateral financial institutions. The World Bank, the IMF, the Asian Development Bank and even the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) all adopt weighted voting systems and majority voting rules. We explain why the BRICS countries adopt these unprecedented designs through precise power measurements and carefully designed experiments. First, we measure the voting power of each member of the BRICS' NDB and CRA under the current decision-making systems, using this information as a control group. Then, we remeasure the voting power of each member of the NDB under the assumption that their shares and voting weights are allocated according to their economic weights; additionally, we remeasure the voting power of each country of the CRA under the assumption that majority rules are adopted when decisions are being made on critical issues. Moreover, we establish evaluation indices of power equality and power equity based on classic and variant Gini coefficients and Lorenz curves and use them to assess and compare the power structures of the BRICS' NDB and CRA in the contexts of different voting weight reallocations and different voting rules redesigns. We use these indices to precisely analyse whether the power structures of the BRICS institutions become more equable or equitable in the examined contexts and to investigate the relationship between equality and equity in this setting.},

This dynamism has had positive effects on jobs, the development of urban facilities and the quality of city life; but its effects have been pernicious on land and housing prices.

  abstract = {The physical need or status-quo approaches have not provided the appropriate conceptual framework for guiding food aid policies. As a response to this, models based on household or individual behavior are being articulated to explain food vulnerability. However, due to the complexity of these models and their data requirements, they have yet to become operational for the determination of food needs. This paper proposes a simple alternative approach for estimating food needs by implicitly taking into account the income distribution patterns, levels of poverty and market structure in a society. This new method, termed the `'social need'' approach, is illustrated using a case study from Madagascar. During the last decade domestic availability of major nutrients in the country remained above the total per capita caloric need (physical requirements) of the population. Nevertheless, the country experienced a major food crisis in 1982 and 1983. Because of relatively stable economic, social and political inequality in a country over the medium term, the 1982-83 food availability per Adult Equivalent Unit (AEU) can be used as the level of social need for Madagascar to prevent food-shortage-triggered social disruptions. This social need definition suggests exponentially increasing risk of food shortages in the country beginning in the early 1980s. The probability of food shortages in Madagascar was less than 10\%, on average, between 1975-1985; however, it is projected to surpass 65\% between 1990 and the year 2000. These findings demonstrate the need for urgent adoption of policies to influence agricultural development, socioeconomic inequalities and improved access to food for the vulnerable groups.},

Drawing from socio-historical accounts of racial disadvantage in the U.S. South that deal explicitly with the interrelation of race and political economy, we pose a model of racial politics and competition that acknowledges the potential for elite influence. We then test the model making use of North Carolina county data from the 1980s. Results suggest that a large black population coupled with a concentrated and homogeneous elite, traditionally dependent upon racial exploitation and division, increases the white-black voter registration gap and racially polarized voting among whites. These processes are mediated, at least partially, by both local political access and local levels of stratification. Findings support a dynamic class-theoretical interpretation of racial inequality and division as well as extended racial competition and stratification frameworks. On an even more general level, the theoretical argument posed and empirical evidence presented suggest that socio-historical and class-theoretical considerations be accorded more weight in analyses of contemporary racial inequality and competition processes.},

Seven independent variables representing life experiences were marriage, parenting, unemployment, type of employer, work with people, educational attainment; and location. After controlling for initial differences, each of the seven variables used to operationalize life experience was found to be significantly related to one or more of the four dependent variables representing developmental outcomes.

  abstract = {Gender relations-embodied in the sexual division of labor, compulsory heterosexuality, gendered forms of citizenship,Ind political participation, ideologies of masculinity and femininity, and the like-profoundly shape the character of welfare states. Likewise, the institutions of social provision-the set of social assistance and social insurance programs and universal citizenship entitlements to which we refer as `'the welfare state''-affect gender relations. Until recently, two broad approaches to gender relations and welfare states predominated: one which saw states contributing to the social reproduction of gender hierarchies, and a second which saw states having an ameliorative impact on gender inequality. More recently, two new strands of research have emerged emphasizing the variation in the effects of social policies on gender.},
